not without insisting that the deep state had stolen his victory once in office clinton would have set to work building on the obama legacy the united state would have remained in the paris climate accord the iran nuclear agreement would still be in force and perhaps a more robust health care plan might even be in place competent civil servant would have taken charge of federal agency a tax cut for the wealthy wouldn t have gone into effect and the democrat would have been well positioned in to reelect the first woman president and build a stronger congressional majority america wouldn t have gone down the rabbit hole of trumpism civic discourse wouldn t have been coarsened the country wouldn t now be in such complete and utter hey wake up if hillary had somehow managed to eke out a victory in she would soon enough have faced a republican party a hostile to compromise a the one that hamstrung barack obama opposition from congress and republican controlled state combined with her own centrist instinct would have kept the country mired in a failing status quo an increasingly unequal economy crumbling infrastructure a growing carbon footprint a morbidly obese pentagon and other sign of a declining superpower that we ve come to know so well now imagine what would have happened when the pandemic struck in clinton would have responded more competently than the donald because virtually anyone over the age of would have been better suited to handle the emergency than he wa indeed if the united state had managed covid with anything faintly approaching the competency of say germany under angela merkel the country would have had by my calculation million infection and about death on the eve of the election that obviously would be better than the million infection and more than death the united state is currently experiencing keep in mind however that american wouldn t have known just how bad the situation could have been quite the opposite having set up a bully pulpit in an alt right fox news style medium conglomerate after his loss in donald trump would have led the charge on clinton s mismanagement of the pandemic and her direct responsibility for all those death he would have assured u that the resulting economic downturn with striking number of american left unemployed could have been avoided and that he a president would have prevented both those death and business cutback by immediately closing all border and deporting any suspicious foreigner he would have labeled the president killer clinton and given the misogyny of significant part of the american electorate the name would have stuck in donald trump would have run on a platform of making america great again and won in a landslide don t however think of this a just some passing exercise in alternative history substitute joe biden for hillary clinton in the passage you ve just read and you ll have a grim but plausible prediction of what could happen over the next four year on the road to hillary clinton would have faced challenge of every sort if she d won the presidency in they nonetheless pale in comparison to what now awaits joe biden and kamala harris the republican are already gunning for the new president they re blocking the transition process to handicap the incoming administration president trump ha forbidden federal agency from even cooperating with the biden harris team the presidential election form part of the republican party s denialism trifecta the pandemic climate change and now biden s victory are all simply liberal myth the republican party will either control the senate pending the outcome of two run off race in georgia or at least be able to disrupt any major piece of legislation the biden administration will be hard pressed to roll back the tax cut the republican handed out to the wealthy in pas a major green infrastructure bill or expand affordable health care when biden try to implement a nationally cohesive program to combat covid through more testing tracing and investment in medical equipment he s guaranteed to face resistance from a number of republican governor who have refused even to mandate the wearing of mask and then there are all those republican appointed judge just itching to rule on any legal challenge to biden s executive order not to speak of a supreme court now located in the bleacher beyond right field that will serve a an even greater constraint on an activist agenda and those are just the political obstacle the pandemic is clearly spiraling out of control the economy ha yet to crawl out of it hole and donald trump ha a couple of more month to scorch the earth before his army of incompetent are driven out of washington d c then there are the million american who just voted for him despite his criminal conduct gross mismanagement and near psychotic view of the world short of a nationwide deprogramming campaign the adherent of the trump cult will continue to cling to their religion and their gun in the biden year they re sure to form an industrial strength tea party opposed to any move the federal government make and let s be clear their resistance will not be exactly gandhian in nature at the same time it s essential to separate their illegitimate complaint laced with racism and misogyny from their all too legitimate grievance concerning the american economy much of trump s base see that economy quite correctly a unfair and the elite a not sharing the wealth unless the democrat succeed in proving themselves to be the party of the and successfully show how the republican are the club by for instance publicizing the true impact of trump s tax cut for the rich the biden administration will fall victim to charge of elitism which is a political death sentence these day everything that hillary clinton faced during her hypothetical first term in office will apply to joe biden in his very real first term trump will never give up on the fantasy that the election wa stolen from him he ll continue to rally his follower through social medium a well a breitbart and the one america news network even if he doesn t have the fire in his year old belly to run in other true believer will

of predictability and their version of stability even the pentagon particularly after the shocking post election dismissal of defense secretary mark esper will be relieved to see the end of the

orban wa the prime minister of hungary from to his time in office wa marked by corruption scandal tax cut and effort to concentrate power in the hand of the executive in the election a coalition of the socialist and liberal party ousted him and governing for eight year seemed to have put orban s brand of authoritarian politics in an early grave in the election however he returned from the political dead and ha since transformed his country from a bastion of liberalism into an autocratic intolerant uber christian friend of vladimir putin in the process the socialist became synonymous with a corrupt economically unjust status quo and the liberal simply disappeared a a party nor is the hungarian experience unique in poland the law and justice party ha moved the country s politics steadily rightward since achieving a parliamentary majority in but it too had an earlier experience from to a part of a governing coalition in between the more liberal civic platform party took charge but did little to improve the livelihood of the bulk of working pole ultimately driving ever more voter into the arm of the right wing law and justice party in it second crack at power those right

for health reason in august he succeeded in making japan great again a an inward looking jingoistic power right wing nationalist certainly learned something about wielding power from their first experience of leadership while their liberal successor by failing to offer fully transformational politics prepared the ground for the return of the right after a period of tumultuous rule most people don t want to jump from a bucking bronco onto another wild horse so the prospect of joe biden and kamala harris appointing a competent cabinet and returning to the status quo ante by among other thing rejoining the world health organization signing onto the paris climate accord and welcoming back the dreamer seems reassuring to many american it won t however be faintly enough to drive a stake

administration would make only half hearted gesture at reform abiding by the kyoto protocol on climate change but not committing to deeper cut in carbon emission canceling a few weapon system but not transforming the military industrial complex tweaking the global war on terror but not ending it and so on apocalypse i concluded come in many different form there are the dramatic effect of sword and fire and famine and then there s the apocalypse of muddling through that s what happens when you just carry on with the same old same old and before you know it poof end of the world it s an apocalypse that s neither too cold nor too hot neither too hard nor too soft it s the apocalypse of the middle the goldilocks apocalypse in a hungry bear named donald trump emerged from the wood and

minute tirade against the u s touting beijing’s foreign policy a superior because “we don’t believe in invading through the use of force or to topple other regime through various mean or to massacre the people of other country ” yang insisted the u s is the “champion” of launching cyberattacks on other country said u s position do not “represent international public opinion ” and said “many people within the united state actually have little confidence in the democracy of the united states” – unlike china where unelected leader allegedly “have the wide support of the chinese people ” “china ha made decisive achievement and important strategic gain in fighting covid chinese coronavirus and we have achieved a full victory in ending absolute poverty in china ” yang boasted in the most astounding passage of his tirade yang – speaking on behalf of a government that ha perpetrated brutal religious repression genocide and slave labor – said china hope the u s will “do better on human rights” in the future china ha made steady progress in human right and the fact is that there are many problem within the united state regarding human right which is admitted by the u s itself a well the united state ha also said that country can’t rely on force in today’s world to resolve the challenge we face and it is a failure to use various mean to topple the so called “authoritarian” state and the challenge facing the united state in human right are deep seated they did not just emerge over the past four year such a black life matter it did not come up only recently so we do hope that for our two country it’s important that we manage our respective affair well instead of deflecting the blame on somebody else in this world yang’s wa followed by a shorter but equally truculent lecture from chinese foreign minister wang yi who rejected “unwarranted accusation from the u s side” and claimed “china’s legitimate right and interest have come under outright suppression” from the united state “china urge the u s side to fully abandon the hegemonic practice of willfully interfering in china’s internal affair this ha been a longstanding issue and it should be changed ” wang said demanding the immediate reversal of sanction imposed on march against chinese official for their role in the oppression of hong kong “this is not supposed to be the way one should welcome his guest and we wonder if this is a decision made by the united state to try to gain some advantage in dealing with china but certainly this is miscalculated and only reflects the vulnerability and weakness inside the united state ” wang said of the sanction the flabbergasted biden team wa reduced to begging reporter to stay after a scheduled four minute photo session so they could muster some sort of rebuttal to the chinese attack the best thing they could come up with wa national security adviser jake sullivan’s attempt to zing china by saying “a confident country is able to look hard at it own shortcoming and constantly seek to improve” – which is just a weak sound bite imitation of the minute harangue sullivan had just endured from his chinese guest the south china morning post scmp provided an instructive comparison of the background comment made by member of the two delegation after the encounter the chinese took a victory lap and said they felt bad about pummeling biden’s team but they were overcome by righteous indignation over the rude reception they received while the biden official whined that the chinese talked for too long chinese state medium later quoted an unnamed chinese official – in a background briefing after the first day of talk – that china wa sincere in it dialogue with the u but the american side had overrun it opening remark and made groundless accusation against china “this is not a way of hospitality nor doe it conform to diplomatic etiquette china ha responded solemnly to this ” the official said according to state broadcaster cctv in another sign of tension the two side did not sit down for a meal together generally customary in meeting of this kind and a senior u official speaking on background afterwards countered that the u side had arrived hoping to lay out “the principle interest and value that animate our engagement with beijing” but that the chinese side “seems to have arrived intent on grandstanding focused on public theatrics and dramatics over substance” the official also criticized the chinese side for “violating protocol” by speaking for far longer than the agreed upon two minute the biden team’s failure in alaska is profoundly disturbing for several reason firstly the entire encounter wa foolishly structured in a way that could only benefit the chinese dictatorship a the scmp pointed out the biden white house treated the meeting like a meaningless bit of diplomatic theater all week a “one off with little chance of going anywhere ” that made it a perfect venue for the kind of “grandstanding” by china that biden’s people complained about much of the world is bowing to beijing’s tyranny while being fully aware of it terrible action in xinjiang hong kong and the south china sea resistance is not a matter of “raising awareness” about china’s offense a bold confident aggressive utterly amoral tyranny wa not about to lose a grandstanding competition against an “america last” white house the second problem flow from that america last attitude everything yang and wang threw at the visibly unnerved blinken and sullivan echo the democrat party’s vicious critique of the american people the chinese know exactly what they are doing when they invoke black life matter rhetoric to hector a democrat administration about human right in america they were merely throwing the rhetoric of blinken and sullivan’s own party right back in their face what response could the biden team have made “no black american aren’t getting slaughtered in the street by racist cop no matter what our party ha been saying for the past year you take that back ” the third and most disturbing issue is that all of this wa entirely predictable but somehow the biden team and it intelligence briefers were taken completely by surprise the briefest perusal of chinese state medium reveals the chinese communist party ccp constantly us left wing american rhetoric and medium coverage to attack the united state everything yang and wang said came straight out of boilerplate editorial in the global time and people’s daily alaska wa the most heavily telegraphed diplomatic ambush in modern history but somehow the biden white house walked right into it and looked astonished to find themselves at the red wedding instead of a brookings institution roundtable discussion',\n",

full of people who believe in public postal service and that board must be ready to fire him quickly according to the post dejoy—with the support of the usps board of governor which is composed entirely of trump appointees—is preparing to put all first class mail onto a single delivery track a move that would mean slower and more costly delivery for both consumer and commercial mailer the postmaster general ha also discussed plan to eliminate a tier of first class mail—letters bill and other envelope sized correspondence sent to a local address—designated for delivery in two day the

biden wa the face of establishment “meh the epitome of could be worse complacency he vaguely sympathized with working people but went along with the neoliberal mania for lower tax fewer regulation and “freer market he assumed the civil right era had put america s demon to rest and he never saw the dark force gathering behind his predecessor donald trump until it wa too late one year ago during a bruising primary against more progressive rival biden looked like a man history had left behind recently however biden ha shown that he understands how the modern u s presidency work both in term of policy and the nation s psyche first among equal early u s president mostly focused on america s relation with non american the constitution of assigned domestic policy to congress not to the president besides the early united state wa a chaotic and ill defined country requiring most president to focus on enforcing federal law a best they could this changed for good under franklin delano roosevelt who held the office between and in the face of the great depression and fascism fdr moved away from his centrist impulse and shifted u s social and economic policy well to the left his new deal vastly expanded the executive branch of the u s government and made it far more relevant to most american to be sure congressman resisted not just a rival republican but also a member of a separate and equal branch of government so did governor who embraced the american tradition of local self government over centralized rule the modern day president life with these duelling legacy on one hand he now set the priority for domestic a well a foreign affair and wields enormous discretionary power over a sprawling federal government on the other hand he must work with ally in the house

when to frame an issue and how and when to let the argument unfold on msnbc and fox news most importantly he understands that the dominant ideology of the past year especially the neoliberal dictum that market know better than nation simply won t do in the face of a pitiless virus and the human wreckage it ha left behind this is why biden the ultimate moderate wa able to pas the trillion

emotional unity among the american people canadian may well pause here to ask why such unity is necessary why doe america require such emotional togetherness why can t it million people just feel what they feel and still agree to get along why can t they live together a a big and complex society different but not divided it s complicated but after studying american nationalism for many year i think the reason is that american aren t nearly a nation minded a we long to be our nationalism isn t obvious or intuitive we don t have a distinctive language or ancient culture we don t even have a clear or stable sense of any homeland a common patrie to which we can feel attached much of american history and culture is about moving away from wherever we re from to settle in the u s usually at the expense of indigenous population this is especially true for white settler although black american also sought freedom by heading west or north our cherished individualism and mythic frontier spirit

       " ('a new report from politico this week tried to shed light on a phenomenon many observer have noticed in the white house vice president kamala harris seems to have a more central and emphasized role in the new administration than is typically afforded to her position — more significant than even joe biden s role in the early day of president barack obama s first term according to politico this is completely deliberate on president biden s part — because he want to treat harris better than obama treated him some aide from his time a vice president say biden is also trying to avoid early misstep that he belief barack obama made in their relationship it s all about how he wa or wished he wa treated during the obama year especially in the beginning said an aide to biden from when he wa vice president to the extent there wa rockiness in the relationship it wa mostly in the beginning it even recounted an early event from obama and biden s relationship that painted the picture of a tense relationship when biden said during the campaign that u s adversary would likely test obama s mettle in the opening month of the presidency obama called biden and told him he didn t need such public tutoring i don t need you acting like you re my henry higgins obama snapped biden would tell his aide later according to former adviser jeff connaughton higgins being the character in the musical my fair lady who teach eliza doolitte about polite society—yes we re huge mfl fan biden s private reaction he told people wa whoa where did this come from this is clearly a guy who could restrict my role to attending state funeral or just put me in a closet for four year according to connaughton s book the payoff biden concluded i m going to have to earn his trust but i m not going to grovel to this guy my manhood is not negotiable it s not clear how accurate this account of biden s motivation is or if the version of his relationship with obama is overly one sided but it is clear that the current administration is going out of it way to emphasize that vice president s role — something that happened even before their election a politico reported administration official frequently refer to the biden harris administration even though it s more typical to refer to the administration using only the president s name the report even note that official largely refer to the predecessor administration a the trump administration — and generally the term trump penny administration wa much le common harris is frequently seen alongside the president in the oval office during public meeting and event and her view are frequently highlighted by the white house one amusing part of the report noted pete buttigieg s transportation department however hasn t been a consistently on message after buttigieg s swearing in the department initially referred to it a the biden administration on feb a department press release quoted buttigieg hailing the biden harris administration s commitment to clean transportation but elsewhere the release referred simply to the biden administration buttigieg s office declined to comment though the observation may seem trivial it hint at the real stake here buttigieg want to be president a doe harris and by highlighting harris s role prominently biden may be quite intentionally molding her in the public s eye a his natural predecessor this wa my interpretation when it became clear the biden administration would be consistently highlighting harris s role the choice make sense vice president often run for president and they often become president that is of course how biden — who had previously been unsuccessful in his bid for the white house — came to occupy the oval office so it s reasonable to assume harris ha a decent chance at becoming president someday and biden may intend to give her the best shot at reaching the goal presumably he only picked her a his running mate because he thought she d be good at the job making her already seem presidential could indeed be a big help in her effort especially since harris will have to fight against misogynistic and racist prejudice in order to win hanging over all of this of course is the undeniable fact that biden is not a young man because of his age it can t be assumed he ll run again in or even that he ll be healthy enough to make it through a full first term harris may have to take over for him sooner than expected making it all the more important to ensure there will be a smooth transition if it happens that s certainly easier if harris is deeply involved in the everyday work of the president — not shunted to the sideline like the fictional vice president selina meyer portrayed by julia louis dreyfus in hbo s veep there may indeed be truth to politico s reporting that biden is actively trying to be a better president to harris than obama wa to him despite the fact that biden and obama were perceived a and often played up the image of being close friend some reporting ha cast doubt on their bond including a recent story in the hill that suggested the former president wa not enthused about his vice president s campaign but there s a key difference in the biden harris relationship that may make it more congenial than the obama biden partnership obama came into office with a huge wave of enthusiasm but he also faced deep well of skepticism because of his youth and race he had picked biden a his running mate to balance out some of these concern from the public and commentariat and perhaps because he falsely thought biden s own age meant he would have abandoned his own presidential ambition it s not hard to see though how this would make obama guarded around biden and eager to put him in his place obama likely felt the needed to prove that he deserved to be where he wa and that meant he didn t want to be seen a relying on biden biden whatever his fault likely lack any similar insecurity on the first day of his presidency white house press secretary jen psaki said biden felt like he wa coming home after eight year a vice president and decade in the senate he think being president is exactly where he belongs without the self doubt it s easy for him to make a prominent place for his vice president',\n",

       " ('yes but you lose by photo via bird and stone blog ron brownstein make a pitch at the atlantic for joe biden’s white house to place more emphasis on working directly with city rather than state government for advancing his priority texas governor greg abbott for example remains hostile to climate change effort and basically to any initiative coming from a democratic president brownstein cite the eagerness of lina hidalgo chief elected officer of harris county texas houston to partner with biden on a range of issue from pandemic recovery to transportation to affordable housing in addition to addressing the effect of climate change hidalgo’s enthusiasm about working with biden illustrates the president’s opportunity to fundamentally rethink the way the federal government pursues it domestic goal biden could advance both his agenda and his political interest by channeling his policy through major metropolitan area without relying on state a his principal partner a previous white house have traditionally done city and their inner suburb need an immediate lifeline from washington to stabilize their finance after the devastation of the pandemic but once those community regain their balance they could become crucial ally for biden by working with big metro the president would be aligning federal policy with powerful economic social and electoral trends—and empowering local official overwhelmingly sympathetic to his core objective if biden can forge such partnership he could both ignite a new wave of local innovation and solidify the democratic party’s advantage in the fast growing diverse and well educated metro area that have become the bedrock of it electoral coalition brownstein’s premise is attractive a far a it go but a he say with this approach biden could advance his agenda and his political interest by improving democratic prospect in metro area where brownstein go wrong biden face better odds working with metro area because many are already under democratic control while republican tend to dominate the countryside the reason state government are unreliable partner for a democratic president is that republican control state legislature and governors’ mansion and that because even a democrat dominate vote total in the few large city republican eat their lunch in smaller more numerous rural county if all democrat care about winning is statewide race and the presidency fine a growing metro area become larger percentage of state population building democratic capacity there could help win more statewide contest maybe even elect a senator or two in state such a texas but emphasis on metropolitan concern without democrat expanding their influence in the redder hinterland could simply exacerbate the urban rural divide that leaf the gop controlling a majority of state legislature and thus state and federal redistricting the u s constitution’s allocation of senator already give rural state over representation in the u s senate gerrymandering tilt the balance even more in the gop’s favor candidate in statewide race care primarily about finding voter in bulk about getting the most bang for the campaign buck on a short calendar they concentrate their effort in big metro area and rural area get lip service state legislator have to win vote in district whether they trend urban or rural out there democrat struggle presidential coattail are not enough to overcome that lavishing even more attention on urban area will not improve the situation and solidify the view that democrat couldn’t care le about rural american whatever their party how well did an american strategy built on holding the city work in vietnam brownstein acknowledges the problem but dismisses it where it come to presidential contest more and more city and their inner suburb find their interest converging—while those interest simultaneously diverge from the conservative priority of the mostly white people living in small town and rural place away from urban center a november’s presidential result demonstrated if you draw an imaginary beltway around almost any major metropolitan area democrat are growing stronger inside that circle while republican are consolidating their position outside of it tabulation by the daily yonder a website focusing on rural issue found that biden not only won the county anchored by the nation’s biggest urban center by a crushing million vote but also carried their inner suburb by more than million and even won midsize urban center by million or so those three category of community provided almost four fifth of all biden’s vote trump dominated the smaller place beyond those center but that wasn’t nearly enough for him to overcome biden’s advantage in the metro area again if your electoral calculus center on biden’s agenda and biden’s political interest a metro focus make sense but if democrat in the state want to control more of their legislature and to grow their bench for winning senate seat and governorship they must work to narrow the urban rural divide they must start winning more outside urban center a much a grassroots democrat now want to

campaign may not see a having sufficient return on short term investment the approach is effective if not a replicable by state and local party committee whose mission is winning election bang for the buck referring to how republican gerrymandered georgia cotton say timestamp “they carve that metro up and they say we will give all the black folk metro atlanta and we’ll take the rest of the state

state level that’s what the party will ultimately embrace ” he writes citing carolyn fiddler the communication director for daily ko one might surmise the majority of those represent rural district higher turnout in the city won’t end their tenure nor will widening the urban rural divide it is not that brownstein’s strategy ha no merit it doe it just will not address the longer term radicalism

debate with trump in september in which he threatened the unilateral destruction of brazil’s economy in response to a question on climate change policy the debate featured no foreign policy question and the moderator had not mentioned brazil “brazil the rainforest of brazil are being torn down are being ripped down more carbon is absorbed in that rainforest than every bit of carbon that’s emitted in the united state ” biden asserted abruptly “instead of doing something about that i would be gathering up and making sure we had the country of the world coming up with billion and say ‘here’s billion stop stop tearing down the forest and if you don’t then you’re going to have significant economic consequence ” biden appeared to be referencing a global left wing campaign blaming bolsonaro for allegedly out of control fire in the amazon rainforest propelled in part by a false post from french president emmanuel macron on twitter using a photo from at least bolsonaro ha been president of brazil since bolsonaro replied to biden in a letter referring to him a a “coward” and saying his threat were “unnecessary” and “difficult to understand ” bolsonaro subsequently threatened to declare

biden said advertisement despite the stepped up pace of vaccine production the work of inoculating american could extend well into the summer official said depending both on the government’s capacity to deliver dos and americans’ willingness to roll up their sleeve biden’s announcement quickly raised expectation for when the nation could safely emerge from the pandemic with the promise of speedier vaccination but even a he expressed optimism biden quickly tempered the outlook for a return to life a it wa before the virus hit “i’ve been cautioned not to give an answer to that because we don’t

administer dos in retail pharmacy which federal official believe can double or triple their pace of vaccination advertisement more than dos of the j j vaccine will also be distributed this week to

month “there’s a difference between conversation and it moving forward ” she said the white house said merck would devote two plant to the production process one would make the vaccine and the other would handle inserting the vaccine into vial and ensuring strict quality control psaki said the biden administration wa using it power under the defense production act to help merck retool to work on the production still it wa not immediately clear when the effect of merck’s assistance would be reflected in supply federal official have cautioned that setting up the highly specialized manufacturing line to produce vaccine would take month compared to the two dose version produced by moderna and pfizer the j j vaccine is le resource intensive to distribute and administer making it critical for u

running a propaganda war to manufacture the impression that biden’s agenda is already a catastrophe the post report that miller is encouraging gop lawmaker to step up attack along these line ad central to this will be the public battle over migrant child when the new texas facility opened conservative miller included scoffed that biden is being forced to resume trump policy because effort to reverse them have collided with reality vindicating trump all this is nonsense on migrant child biden ha not restarted trump’s policy what biden is doing ha nothing in common with “kids in cage and none of this prof trump wa right in any way here’s a quick corrective why did biden reopen a migrant facility in texas it’s important to note that the texas facility is run not by border patrol but by the office of refugee resettlement federal law and legal settlement require border patrol to take in child and hold them for no more than hour then transfer them to orr which then try to place them with relative or guardian ad ad thus the reopening of the texas facility doe not constitute holding child at the border it constitutes using a warehouse like facility to deal with overflow at orr the waystation before kid hopefully get moved to a better life this isn’t “kids in cages” redux that scandal arose when trump separated family to hold parent rather than releasing them creating a new class of unaccompanied child that didn’t exist before in this case the overflow at orr is being caused in part by the rise in migrant child arriving at the border alone not after being separated from parent why are more child migrating there is a rise in young migrant arriving at the border and the trumpists cite this too a vindication it isn’t ad the trumpists claim this is due to biden signaling change to trump policy — which is supposedly proving a draw to migrant who now think they can get in — again proving trump right ad some of the increase is due to biden allowing migrant to have due process but after being trapped in mexico due to trump’s policy that’s a good thing since those victim of trump’s policy … deserve due process and humane treatment trumpists will claim this supposed biden permissiveness is drawing more migrant relative to last year to make the trek but wendy young the president of kid in need of defense told me it’s far more complex than this migration wa suppressed last year during the pandemic and arrival are now rising due to many factor in central america young said ad “there continues to be a tremendous amount of violence corruption and deprivation young told me “children leave because they’re forced out of their home country ” young added that child are often targeted by gang trying to force them to join under threat so “families will very often send children” to try to connect with relative or friend in the united state “literally to save their life ” ad thus much of the spike is caused by “push” factor just a previous spike were biden is trying to address those factor with new policy sending aid to the region trumpists simply scoff at these push factor a irrelevant and instead use cruelty and deterrence to keep migrant away the fundamental difference here is whether or not to allow in more migrant who actually have legitimate ground to apply for asylum we should allow more in it’s better policy and it’s more humane can’t we just release child when they arrive this is the rub of the issue and it’s almost never discussed for now there is no alternative to holding migrant child because releasing them would put them in more danger the question then becomes how to do this ad we want orr to take in the migrant child very soon after their arrival because orr is run by the department of health and human service rather than an enforcement agency ad “we can’t just release them ” young told me because they’re “incredibly vulnerable” in a “strange country ” instead young said “you have to provide them with appropriate care ” indeed young noted holding and processing child is necessary for their own long term good because it enables u to determine whether they’re eligible for asylum or other protection and to place them on the correct legal path to get there and so while the texas facility understandably ha terrible connotation it actually represents an unfortunate but better approach than the alternative — either leaving them in enforcement detention or releasing them with nowhere to go but the texas facility is still bad right yes it is very problematic but this part of the debate ha gotten badly confused the problem is not the existence of the facility per se again orr must hold migrant child before placing them and that’s better than releasing them alone this is an emergency measure to deal with overflow ad ad rather the real issue is the condition under which child are held and for how long and this point to the way we can genuinely hold the biden administration accountable what’s the real way to hold biden to account in the short term we need to scrutinize whether the administration make good on it promise to make the condition under which orr hold child including at such warehouse facility genuinely more humane also crucial is whether the administration undertakes reform to speed up the process of moving kid from orr to guardian “we will be watching this closely to ensure that these child receive the service they need and are moved quickly to a place of stability ” young told me ad comparing all this to “kids in cages” confuses the debate in a way that obscures what the biden administration is genuinely trying to accomplish — and thus make it harder to actually hold the administration accountable on it ad',\n",

it it seems to change every day state department spokesman ned price said on march we have seen nothing that would change our assessment concerning the biden administration’s decision to stick with the trump administration’s th hour determination that beijing’s persecution of uighur in china’s xinjiang province constitutes genocide president biden gave a different response last month at a cnn townhall when asked about the atrocity being committed against the uighur when he appeared to write them off a a matter of different cultural norm driven by president xi’s effort to unify the country by creating a united and technically controlled china secretary of state antony blinken gave a third answer during testimony to the house foreign affair committee this week blinken sidestepped biden’s inexplicable statement and said the biden administration will speak out against the persecution of the uighur and also said the administration might consider some sanction and pressure on u s company to not import good made by forced labor or export good to china that can be used for the repression of their people and minority but blinken indicated the uighur genocide will not be an impediment to the administration’s broader agenda with china including climate change and the iran nuclear deal although he and national security adviser jake sullivan plan to express u s concern about human right violation in china and the crackdown in hong kong at a meeting next week in alaska with their chinese counterpart blinken said this meeting also would be used to map out area for cooperation and managing china’s competition with the united state in other word blinken and sullivan will check the box of raising the uighur genocide issue at the alaska meeting and then move on to other issue they view a more important there will be no threat of ultimatum or sanction in response to these atrocity blinken mentioned two other way the biden administration plan to sidestep the uighur genocide issue at this week’s house hearing instead of stating the united state will take swift and decisive action under the genocide convention to sanction china and chinese official over the uighur genocide blinken said the biden administration plan to address the uighur issue by building coalition of like minded country although this idea is certain to go nowhere because few nation are willing to confront beijing it will give the biden administration an excuse for not taking action in addition blinken called on china to allow the united nation access to xinjiang to prove that genocide is not taking place t his is a ludicrous idea because in the unlikely event china ever agrees to let un inspector visit this province it is certain that chinese official will show them a sham potemkin village of well treated and happy uighur beijing would then use such a visit to discredit numerous report – many of which include first hand account and photo – that document genocide ha occurred and continues in xinjiang there wa a surprising fourth and significant view by an incoming biden official this week when former un ambassador samantha power–who ha been nominated to the head the u s agency for international development–tweeted the latest independent report on the uighur issue the report concluded china bear state responsibility for committing genocide against the uighur in breach of the convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide genocide convention based on an extensive review of the available evidence and application of international law to the evidence of the fact on the ground the biden administration’s approach to the uighur genocide go against the central purpose of the genocide convention and why it wa implemented after world war ii in the aftermath of the holocaust stopping one of the worst crime against humanity the convention requires that when act of genocide have been declared signatory are obligated to take action to stop them and punish those responsible this mean the u s must cease normal relation with beijing until the genocide against the uighur is halted at a minimum the biden administration must lead a global boycott of the olympics in beijing but it appears the biden administration plan to weasel it way out of america’s genocide convention obligation while it is quite willing to slam and isolate state it dislike such a saudi arabia and egypt for poor human right record it response to far more serious human right violation in china including persecution of other group such a tibetan christian the falun gong and journalist will be limited to public denunciation calling on other state to take action and proposing a un visit to xinjiang that will either not take place or be exploited by beijing this is an historic opportunity for presidential leadership to truly be the leader of the free world our new president need to make a difficult and painful decision to implement drastic u s measure against the chinese government in response to the genocide against the uighur and pressure other state to do the same tolerating these atrocity with the biden administration’s proposed transactional approach to

intelligence to attack the election to boost donald trump in the russian leader launched another covert assault on american democracy to help trump retain the white house in and he had help assorted trump ally and conservative medium outlet —including rudy giuliani fox news and oan—were useful idiot for putin and his clandestine operator those are the damning conclusion of a report released tuesday by the office of the director of national intelligence even though putin failed in his second attempt to elect trump the unclassified document present a disturbing account of a foreign autocrat exploiting all too willing medium and political player in the united state to undermine the nation’s political system giuliani and his medium ally were key element of a russian disinformation scheme mounted to keep trump in power aside from the main story of putin’s return engagement the report offer a broader study of foreign influence in the election noting that iran tried to use social medium to undercut trump and that china generally stayed out of the picture but it key finding is that “putin authorized and a range of russian government organization conducted influence operation aimed at denigrating president biden’s candidacy and the democratic party supporting former president trump undermining public confidence in the electoral process and exacerbating sociopolitical division in the u ” according to the odni moscow did this by using “proxies linked to russian intelligence to push influence narratives—including misleading or unsubstantiated allegation against president biden—to u medium organization u official and prominent u individual including some close to former president trump and his administration ” the report doesn’t name these dupe but it’s clear who they are foremost among them is giuliani who a trump’s personal lawyer sought dirt on biden from sketchy source in ukraine and elsewhere and a slew of rightwing medium outlet including fox oan newsmax and others amplified and disseminated the anti biden swill giuliani collected the odni note that moscow’s “primary effort” in “revolved around a narrative—that russian actor began spreading a early a —that alleged corrupt tie between president biden his family and other u official and ukraine russian intelligence service relied on ukraine linked proxy and these proxies’ networks—including their u contacts—to spread this narrative to give moscow plausible deniability of their involvement ” one side aim of this clandestine project wa to reduce trump’s support of the ukrainian government the report show how trump and his conservative ally fell for moscow’s covert action embracing the kremlin’s anti biden and anti ukraine disinformation and casting it throughout the u political medium environment the paper state a network of ukraine linked individuals—including russian influence agent konstantin kilimnik—who were also connected to the russian federal security service fsb took step throughout the election cycle to damage u tie to ukraine denigrate president biden and his candidacy and benefit former president trump’s prospect for reelection we ass this network also sought to discredit the obama administration by emphasizing accusation of corruption by u official and to falsely blame ukraine for interfering in the presidential election these are the line that trump and his gop defender have been pushing for year especially during trump’s first impeachment ukraine not russia intervened in the election and that the real scandal wa not trump’s attempt to push kiev to gin up a baseless investigation targeting biden but the biden activity in ukraine according to this report trump gop rep jim jordan and devin nunes fox host sean hannity and many others on the trumpian right were parroting putin’s propaganda one fact the report leaf out is that kilimnik wa a former business associate of paul manafort who wa a top trump campaign official for much of during that time manafort secretly met with kilimnik and shared polling data with him the odni sidestep this point but the big picture includes trump’s campaign chief having clandestinely hobnobbed—colluding —with a russian agent who is now connected to moscow’s covert plot to undermine biden kilimnik’s appearance a a moscow manipulator in two consecutive election ought to be front page news the odni go on to report that kilimnik andriy derkach a ukrainian legislator tied to russian intelligence and their associate “sought to use prominent u person and medium conduit to launder their narrative to u official and audience these proxy met with and provided material to trump administration linked u person to advocate for formal investigation hired a u firm to petition u official and attempted to make contact with several senior u official ” this appears at least in part to be a reference to giuliani’s endeavors—which included the effort of pro trump lawyer joe digenova and victoria toensing and conservative journalist john solomon—to collect and promote unproven allegation about biden related to his son hunter’s business activity in ukraine in essence the odni say trump’s personal lawyer and his comrade and their ally in the medium were key element of a russian disinformation scheme mounted to help trump hold on to power this wa not the only recent russian attempt to mess with u politics the odni say after the midterms—when the democrat won back the house—russian intelligence cyber operative hacked organization affiliated with the democratic party and in and the report say russian military intelligence hacker “unsuccessfully targeted u political actor ” they also tried to penetrate burisma the ukrainian company that hunter biden worked with the odni also report that during the presidential primary russian online influence actor “backed candidate from both major u political party that moscow viewed a outsider ” it doesn’t state who that wa according to the odni the kremlin’s troll and bot were busily assisting trump throughout the election season on social medium they “sought to amplify mistrust in the electoral process by denigrating mail in ballot highlighting alleged irregularity and accusing the democratic party of voter fraud ” they “generally supported president trump and his commentary” and boosted “disparaging content” about biden while promoting “conspiratorial narrative about the covid pandemic ” they “sought to discourage u left leaning audience from voting ” the report doesn’t provide great detail but it doe reveal that the kremlin’s key influence operation the lakhta internet research troll farm once known a the internet research agency used “social medium persona news website and u persona to deliver tailored content to subset of the u population ” and it established “short lived troll farm that used unwitting third country national in ghana mexico and nigeria to propagate thee u focused narrative probably in response to effort by u company and law enforcement to shut down lir associate persona ” during the trump administration received intelligence indicating the russian were once again trying to interfere on trump’s behalf but trump and his aide refused to share this information with the public and did not provide a full accounting to congress now we know why the thrust of a major trump attack on biden wa a russian invention trump giuliani and the rest of the gang were in cahoot with the kremlin in waging this war on biden they were enabling and aiding yet another russian attack on a u election—just a they did in this is another trump scandal of tremendous significance that will probably not get it due at least this time putin did not win he is one for two in his attempt to make trump president the odni report detail what wa ultimately a failure but it also provides a warning that a possible collaboration in between moscow and trump—or another trumpish candidate—remains a clear and present danger',\n",

       " ('outgoing president donald trump plan to visit the southwest border tuesday to tout the construction of hundred of mile of his border wall and boast about the government s action on immigration – a policy area the president and his administration have treated with near singular focus since the day he took office the last couple month have proved no different the administration ha pushed to finalize a slate of immigration change since the election in an eleventh hour effort to impose more restriction before president elect joe biden assumes the presidency on jan – despite the fact that biden ha pledged to eventually roll back many of trump s immigration policy the recent regulation will be among the last of more than trump era policy change largely limiting legal and illegal immigration and gutting the u s asylum system beyond the impact on immigrant the new regulation could be a major headache for the incoming biden administration serving to only further complicate effort to reverse trump s immigration agenda – an already formidable challenge given the breadth and scope of the trump administration s action over the last four year but the job of the biden white house wa likely made easier last week after democrat won control of the senate following a pair of victory in run off election in georgia a democratic controlled congress could easily and relatively quickly quash several of the recent immigration policy using an oversight law called the congressional review act which effectively allows lawmaker to nullify regulation within congressional working day of a policy being reported to congress a long a the president is on board some but not all of the most significant policy move made by the trump administration in recent week could be thrown out by congress using the oversight tool dashing the effort and saving biden s team from in some case going through the arduous rule making process the trump administration finalized three major asylum regulation in december alone each of which imposes sweeping restriction on who is eligible for asylum in the u s this is an administration that began office in week one by banning all refugee temporarily and they re going to go out on the very last week in office by seeking to ban all asylum seeker say aaron reichlin melnick policy counsel at the nonprofit american immigration council a clear throughline for this administration ha been since the very beginning attack refugee and prevent them from coming to this country one of the regulation dubbed by advocate and policy expert a the death to asylum rule fundamentally alters the current asylum system creating a near total ban on asylum protection for large group of people including those fleeing gender based violence or gang violence it effectively bar migrant from country other than mexico and canada from asylum eligibility a well a immigrant who have been in the u s for more than a year and it allows official to dismiss asylum seeker application a frivolous without a hearing among other change the rule which wa first proposed in june wa finalized on dec and wa set to go into effect monday but it wa blocked friday by a federal judge on the basis that former acting homeland security secretary chad wolf under whom the rule wa crafted and finalized wa illegally serving in his role the trump administration will likely appeal the ruling wolf resigned from his position monday citing ruling about the validity of his appointment on dec the administration finalized a rule to once again deny migrant asylum if they passed through another country before coming to the u s and did not seek asylum in that country first effectively rendering ineligible all non mexican and non canadian asylum seeker it will take effect jan the administration also finalized a separate asylum rule dec expanding the government s ability to deny people asylum on public health ground the rule classifies migrant coming from country with outbreak of infectious disease – such a the coronavirus – a threat to national security that rule is set to go into effect on jan if congress doesn t take action on the police the biden administration could seek remedy in court the rule have faced or almost certainly will face legal challenge and the new administration could agree to alter them a a part of a settlement or to drop the government s defense if a judge rule to block the policy expert say biden s department of homeland security may have to issue new regulation which would likely have to go through the sometimes monthslong rulemaking process that includes accepting public comment the trump administration ha also worked in recent week to alter the asylum system but could nonetheless be eventually reversed by the biden administration the now former acting head of immigration and custom enforcement recently issued a policy directive that could make it harder for unaccompanied migrant child to obtain asylum according to document obtained by buzzfeed news also last month wolf took a trip to central america to meet with official including those from the northern triangle country of guatemala honduras and el salvador wolf discussed the implementation of an asylum cooperative agreement between the u s and el salvador with el salvador s president according to dhs which subsequently announced that the deal wa ready to be implemented dhs three day later announced that a similar agreement with honduras had been officially finalized the u s also ha a similar deal with guatemala the deal which have been in the work for over a year and a half and were signed in allow the u s to send central american migrant back to the region to seek protection in a country neighboring their homeland – meaning for example that a salvadoran migrant seeking protection at the u s southern border could be deported to guatemala to seek protection there instead cartoon on president donald trump view all image the u s agreement with guatemala ha already been implemented and the policy have drawn sharp criticism from advocate and international organization because of the country feeble asylum system the overwhelming majority of asylum seeker sent to guatemala under the deal have chosen not to seek asylum there wolf s trip and the development around the agreement have raised eyebrow not only because of the risk of travel during the pandemic but also because the agreement will be very easy for biden to halt and pull out of expert say but it s not just asylum the administration ha enacted several major change to legal immigration dhs last week finalized a rule that would change the way h b work visa are allocated from a random lottery to a system that prioritizes higher wage worker it s set to go into effect at the beginning of march unless congress or the biden administration work to nullify it the trump administration in november announced major change to the test immigrant must pas to become u s citizen making the exam harder and twice a long a the previous one the administration first announced that it planned to revise the test in july and the change went into effect on dec the revision have drawn sharp criticism from advocate who say that it will make it harder for people to become citizen especially those with limited english proficiency and will increase backlog some of the new question and response have also drawn allegation of conservative bias trump s justice department also recently finalized major increase to the fee for certain immigration court appeal and application which are set to take effect a day before biden is inaugurated and there are several major immigration rule that are pending and could be finalized before the end of trump s term one of those rule would more than double the number of people who must provide biometric screening like iris scan and voice print to the u s government including sponsor of immigrant regardless of

did all the “sabotaging” of “progressives”—which apparently doesn’t include the black community but hey she’s clearly all psyched about trump replacing rbg now there’s a demexit hashtag on twitter for all the people and russian bot that want trump to replace rbg to come together we get gem like this you see everyone should have served sander he shouldn’t have to you know win more vote than the alternative also the dnc is all powerful and mighty and control all lever of power reality quite the opposite how ridiculous a human do you need to be to still claim there is no difference between democrat and republican we heard it in “there is no difference between george w bush an al gore ” then we heard it in with john kerry wa a respite but funny enough not because barack obama wa a liberal champion and then of course came and still people are going to claim “no difference” i have one difference joe biden won’t put another neil gorsuch or brett kavanaugh on the court there are others too amazingly this notion that the dnc is this all powerful being that decides these thing is trumpian qanon level conspiracy theory mongering they did nothing except organize the presidential debate and nothing in those debate disadvantaged sander heck biden couldn’t even raise money his campaign wa perpetually broke it had no field organization and yet he won because black voter rewarded him for his service to the first black president right or wrong that’s what happened and the dnc literally had zero impact on that choice i’ve written about a dozen piece on sanders’ campaign how it never worked to build a majority coalition and thus how it wa destined to lose that wasn t imposed on sander by the dnc but even more broadly speaking sander won the ideological debate and biden is running a far more progressive campaign a a result—even endorsing key sander and elizabeth warren plan the key in the future is to look at progressive who are working toward building a majority coalition like rep ayanna pressley and alexandria ocasio cortez the party ha moved dramatically leftward since the day of howard dean in the early to mid s when civil union between gay couple were considered crazy abortion right were negotiable and every democrat wa talking about how deeply to cut social security now how seriously should we take these people who would rather trump pick rbg’s replacement and give conservative a majority on the supreme court let’s turn to civiqs and look at democratic number in trump’s reelects do you want president trump to be re elected in party id biden trump other democrat republican independent for context here are the exit poll result in party id clinton trump other democrat republican independent so biden is already running ahead of hillary clinton among democrat and even assuming that some of those never biden a hole now call themselves “independent ” biden is still running slightly ahead there too even if you throw in margin of error float between two different poll making apple to apple comparison impossible that still mean that on balance little ha changed since doe that mean that biden is clear to go nope he need to make clear in how he pick his vp and maybe even early cabinet announcement that he value and invite the party’s progressive wing to join his campaign even grabbing a few extra point among those democrat and independent in the “other” category could mean the different between victory and defeat but no matter what biden doe the democratic electorate spoke biden is the nominee and the victor get to write his own script there is only so much we can do to influence his decision moving forward what we can do is acknowledge that politics aren’t about what is ideal but what is possible and right now protecting the liberal minority and maybe even getting a majority is of utmost importance—perhaps the single most important thing we can do this election p s liberal supreme court justice stephen breyer is so perhaps we should be talking about trump’s potential majority',\n",

package one he promised would not simply pull the economy out of a pandemic induced collapse but leave it better than the pandemic found it it would be in the estimation of biden and his aide a signature achievement worthy of the fdr sized legacy to which he aspires “this is our moment to imagine and to build a new american economy ” biden declared on the campaign trail last july that reimagination took the form of his campaign’s build back better plan a whopping trillion in investment across the u economy biden proposed billion in american manufacturing trillion in clean energy and infrastructure more than trillion in child and elder care and billion more to address racial equity with the stimulus in the rearview mirror the white house is now turning it attention to that agenda house speaker nancy pelosi directed her chamber to begin work on a “big bold and transformational infrastructure package” last friday senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y is overseeing similar conversation biden’s campaign promise are now being pitted against the practicality of governing and the scope cost and timing of this package are all up for debate so too is biden’s own hope that the package would garner at least some republican support there’s also a recognition that this next phase could be one of the only chance he ha to pas major legislation during his first term in office and certainly before the midterm elections—especially a long a the senate democrat refused to revoke the filibuster’s vote threshold for passing most legislation biden himself ha only suggested tweak to the filibuster to make it more onerous on the minority not actually getting rid of it and so the job plan ha already become the theater for democrats’ battle over the shape biden’s legacy should take—both in what he achieves and how he achieves it the stimulus bill biden signed last week is by many measure a watershed piece of legislation the price tag alone repudiates the austerity politics that haunted president obama’s recovery effort and safety net protection amount to a war on poverty unseen since lyndon johnson declared his own year ago but despite the size and scope it is a bill conceived of negotiated and passed under the banner of crisis and it construction reflects that most of the ambitious measure are temporary either in the form of one time payment or provision that expire at the end of a year in the week leading up to the stimulus’s passage the white house took meeting with union head business leader and lawmaker that telegraphed a desire to tackle infrastructure next biden said a much during an oval office meeting with democratic house leader and committee chair last month when the president said he could “hardly wait” to begin working with rep

transportation energy broadband education housing and water system for “job creating initiative ” leaving room for “other critical priority ” an open season ha begun for advocate fighting to ensure their pet issue are among those “other critical priority ” at the end of february for example the national domestic worker alliance and the service employee international union asked fellow progressive organization to sign a letter demanding biden uphold the billion investment in home and community based care that his campaign promised “a lot of people are going to be talking about infrastructure in the coming day and that is important absolutely ” ai jen poo the senior adviser to care in action and the executive director of the national domestic worker alliance tell me “what

counter to the bipartisan aspiration the white house and democratic congressional leader have for the package a tension that ultimately could force the administration to choose between achieving it top priority and reaching across the aisle sen joe manchin d w v ha vowed to block an infrastructure package if it ha no republican support but defazio the house’s transportation chair cast doubt on the prospect of that during a congressional progressive caucus meeting earlier this month telling fellow lawmaker behind closed door they should be prepared for a partisan infrastructure push he cited the white house’s meeting with a bipartisan group of lawmaker last month at which defazio learned any climate related measure would be a nonstarter with his gop colleague republican lawmaker are also likely to put up a big fight against any of the tax increase the white house is eyeing to pay for the bill exactly which agenda item will be included remains unclear—as doe the ultimate legislative strategy white house aide are in the early stage of developing a piecemeal legislative approach for key piece of the proposal according to source who have been in touch with the administration on these plan on the climate front for example the white house ha signaled that environmental justice and a clean energy standard would be top priority for an infrastructure package but hasn’t clarified whether the push for those item would be bipartisan or through reconciliation on his end defazio is gearing up to reintroduce a sweeping trillion infrastructure bill that passed the house last year and working with the white house and congressional leadership to determine whether it billion surface transportation reauthorization—which expires in september—might be peeled off into it own separate bill there’s also an expectation that the major element won’t be revealed until late summer giving the white house time to build both a political argument and bipartisan support for it initiative but

lives—perhaps hundred of thousands—and not doing so that’s one of the core question that remain in the wake of the trump presidency the guy in charge could have prevented the death of so many american just by advocating and reaffirming basic public health guidance such a mask wearing and he chose not to last month the lancet commission on public policy and health in the trump era declared that about percent of the nation’s covid death could have been averted had the united state taken these fundamental step and it offered a damning verdict donald trump’s “inept and insufficient” response to the coronavirus crisis wa partly to blame that is while trump wa in office his actions—or inactions—killed many american and out of office he remains a threat to the public health of the nation forty nine percent of republican men in a recent poll said they do not intend to get the coronavirus vaccination throw gop woman into the mix and that number is percent a of mid february percent of american identified themselves a republican down from percent at the time of the november election if these number are accurate that mean that the bloc of republican saying no to the covid vaccine could represent about to percent of the adult population yes there are democrat and independent who won’t take a shot but their number are lower and this is not just about them the refusal of these people to be vaccinated could impede the achievement of herd immunity there is no known magic number of vaccination that will yield that level of communal protection but the vaccination rate needed for herd immunity for covid range between and percent gop vaccination denial could undermine the effort to fully defeat the pandemic this is where trump come in why are all these republicans—especially men—refusing to be shot up with one of the approved vaccine a huge part of the answer is related to the political culture on the right trump ha spent year pushing specific conspiracy theory and playing footsie with others he ha a history of vaccine skepticism and a study published in the journal of experimental social psychology found that trump voter in were particularly prone to anti vaccination attitude and that trump’s tweet in some case intensified these sentiment throughout the covid crisis trump’s supporter have attacked public health expert such a dr anthony fauci and accused him and others of nefariously using the pandemic to limit americans’ freedom or to further even more diabolical plot big time conspiracy peddler alex jones who wa a vip guest at the gop’s convention ha claimed the coronavirus crisis wa a “globalist scheme” to impose one world government if you couldn’t trust fauci and his fellow scientist about masks—and trump indicated he didn’t—why should you trust them now about the vaccine trump never took step to beat back the paranoia which certainly color how some of his devotee now view vaccination moreover last month cnn reported that the anti vaccination movement had somewhat merged with the so called “stop the steal” crusade which falsely claim trump won the election “the anti vaccine message ” cnn noted “may have found a particularly receptive audience among some fervent trump supporter many of whom flout wearing mask and contend the lethality of the virus is overblown ” the bottom line trump helped create the political petri dish in which the current anti vaccination virus ha grown and another factor in this poisonous mix is fox news last week host tucker carlson derided president joe biden’s campaign to vaccinate the entire country claiming falsely the “military will give you that shot” and depicting those seeking vaccination a people willing to be “obedient” to biden well which fox viewer want to bend the knee before biden so it wa not surprising when fauci went on fox this past weekend and essentially begged trump to appeal to his folk to get a shot “i think it would make all the difference in the world ” he said fauci even tried to exploit trump’s well known vanity remarking that trump “is a such a strongly popular person…it would be very helpful for the effort for that to happen ” trump ha yet to respond while former president jimmy carter george w bush bill clinton and barack obama—and their wives—have all joined an ad campaign to spur covid vaccination trump ha stayed on the sideline he and melania trump received their vaccination in january in private without public comment sharing their vaccination experience with the world could have conveyed a powerful message to magaworld’s skeptical denizen but the trump did not use the occasion to push others to seek vaccination instead trump ha allowed vaccine hesitancy to fester among his supporter yet trump want credit last week the banned from twitter ex president issued a statement in search of personal glory “i hope everyone remembers when they’re getting the covid …vaccine that if i wasn’t president you wouldn’t be getting that beautiful ‘shot’ for year at best and probably wouldn’t be getting it at all i hope everyone remembers ” don’t ask why “shot” is in quotation mark naturally this statement wa false the first vaccine approved the one developed by pfizer wa not created under the auspex of trump’s operation warp speed and other country developed vaccine within a year but here wa trump desperately attempting to elbow his way into the picture a the biden crew wa ramping up vaccination production and delivery and showing how a competent guided by science administration can operate while grabbing for credit trump though wa not willing to take the obvious companion step encourage vaccination why not one possible explanation he is a man propelled by spite and revenge before becoming president he often gave lecture on the secret of his supposed success during those talk he described his top rule for doing business this way “get even with people if they screw you screw them back time a hard i really believe it ” a fellow like that—a devotee of revenge—may be incapable of assisting the man who beat him even if that mean thousand of american will suffer beyond psychological resistance there is another likely reason were trump to join the chorus of public figure touting the benefit and safety of the covid vaccination he would be boosting biden’s top priority and helping biden’s presidency become a success such a move would not advance trump’s political interest if he is considering a rematch he won’t want biden to be the covid hero and having fueled and exploited right wing paranoia—throughout the pandemic and during the post election period—to build and expand his political base why would trump throw that all away a call from trump to get vaccinated could appear to some of his loyalist a unsettling counter programming now we’re supposed to do what fauci say how discombobulating would that be it would cut against trump’s embrace of anti elite know nothingism he would be conceding that biden and the fauci hugger were right all along after all how can you own the libs if you acknowledge they are right about the vaccine the election showed that ten of million of american don’t give a damn what the expert say they had watched trump respond to the crisis by defying the demand that he endorse and champion basic public health measures—and they were fine with that they relished his politicization of the pandemic they don’t want a pivot and trump doesn’t do pivot by declining to join the campaign to promote vaccination trump is encouraging the dark suspicion toward the vaccine within trump nation that probably mean more american will suffer and die trump doesn’t seem to care about that then again he never did trump is now just staying true to the

busting action such a demanding an end to the senate’s filibuster rule which now effectively requires a supermajority to pas almost all legislation it wouldn’t take much for biden to be more pro labor

       " ('wednesday fox news channel’s tucker carlson speculated on the motivation of president joe biden’s immigration policy which included a pledge to aid asylum seeker if they hold off a the current border surge crisis wane transcript a follows carlson we just got back from el salvador a little over an hour ago before we left central america this afternoon we took a covid test the one where the nurse ram the q tip up your nose and root around trying to find your frontal lobe until your eye water you probably experienced it it’s pretty unpleasant trying to be responsible though so you endure it and of course like everyone entering the united state by plane we had no choice anyway the airline demanded it we couldn’t come home until we took the test and that’s because a they often tell u our authority are totally committed to keeping u safe from this deadly virus so that’s the protocol if you’re coming from el salvador to the united state legally you take the test but what if you’re coming illegally what if you rode the top of a freight train from el salvador up through mexico and just jumped the border when you got here well a it happens this morning we interviewed an active m member a convicted murderer who said that he did exactly that so the question is do people like him the one who break our law to get here have to submit to mandatory covid testing once they’ve been apprehended by american authority and the answer is actually no they don’t under this administration they don’t have to and they don’t illegal alien are now exempt from the public health measure that have been imposed by force on the rest of u by the u s government illegal alien come and go a they please no one seems to care if they spread deadly virus to the rest of the american population it’s hard to believe that’s actually happening but it is happening we verified it today the new dhs secretary admitted in congressional testimony that the biden administration is releasing foreign national into american neighborhood without even bothering to check if they’ve been infected with covid now given the authoritarian lockdown the rest of u have lived under for the last year the one that have crushed the country it is hard to understand this policy is anything but an act of violence and hostility toward our country it is an utter betrayal they don’t care about you and they’re saying that a clearly a they possibly can joe biden is saying it too a reporter asked biden if he planned to visit the border to see for himself the disaster that’s unfolding there “not at the moment ” he replied dismissively a if he had better thing to do we’d love to know what those thing are later that day a reporter asked kamala harris what she knew about the current immigration crisis the one that her administration caused more than a hundred thousand foreign national are flooding in every month like the border doesn’t even exist some of them are gang member others appear to be on fbi terror watch list more than of them are child or unaccompanied minor now in u s custody it all add up to an enormous maybe unprecedented wave of humanity coming into america right now but kamala harris didn’t seem to have any idea it wa happening quote “i haven’t been briefed on anything today about it ” she said she wa too busy promoting critical race theory and making sure there are boy on your daughter’s track team ha there ever been in administration this reckless and destructive what’s happening on the border tonight will change this country forever a lot of thing won’t this will and you should know that unlike other disaster mass illegal immigration is permanent no one ever really get sent home over the past year the population of the united state ha exploded by nearly million people mostly due to immigration were you even aware that that happened you’re not supposed to say a word about it a every year the united state get steadily more jammed with people and at the same time more chaotic and le cohesive a the open space shrink a nature itself recedes in the face of yet another strip mall or apartment complex or fast food outlet to serve the new people this is becoming a crowded country and crowded country are ugly unhappy country why are we letting that happen well that’s a rhetorical question of course no one asked u what we wanted they just did it and by the way no one asked the country these immigrant are coming from either that’s something that had never even occurred to u until yesterday when we talked to the president of el salvador he ha lost a third of his population over the year to immigration to the united state el salvador is a charming country in a lot of way but it’s still a very poor place so when american politician offer free education and free healthcare and free all kind of thing to anyone who can just make it across the border million of salvadoran accept their offer and why wouldn’t they accept it so they migrate in huge group and that hurt this country but it also weakens el salvador listen to that country’s president’s perspective begin video clip nayib bukele president of el salvador if you don’t provide for your people economic opportunity if your economy is doing bad if your security is doing bad people are going to — people are going to leave and they’re going to go and try to find a rich country right they’re not going to leave for guatemala right they’re not going to go and live — they want to go to the united state so that make these country dependent on immigration because you become an exporter of people you’re not exporting product or a service you’re exporting people so that make your economy dependent on that because then those people send money back to their home country which is not a good economic formula so it’s bad for the united state because immigration will go up and it’s bad for our country because people leaving the country will go up a well so it’s bad for both of u end video clip carlson “it’s bad for both of u ” the u s and el salvador and he is absolutely right no one say it but imagine if a third of the boldest most ambitious people in your country just left what would that mean for your future the overfunded ngo and self satisfied compassion monger who promote open border haven’t thought a moment about that because they don’t care they even know who the president el salvador is how many soulcycle mom with “no human is illegal” sign on their front lawn could even name him we’re guessing right around none but if you’re looking for conclusive evidence of how little they actually care about the latin american servant who walk their dog and wash their sheet consider the almost complete silence from fashionable american liberal a the biden administration’s holding pen for immigrant child fill beyond capacity they’re choosing to ignore this a it happens here’s what it look like begin videotape unidentified female tonight more than child are in custody at overcrowded processing facility a percent surge in the last week “someone stole all her money along the way ” many discover that getting here is just the beginning some migrant describe crowded immigration processing center he say it wa packed with people — without showering facility they like to shower and some say they slept under a bridge overnight unidentified male voice over attorney for some of the child told u kid a young a one sometimes go day without bathing rarely see the sun and the sound of cry is constant end video clip cooper so it’s bad and it’s about to get much worse there’s been a percent increase in the number of family apprehended by custom and border protection since october that number is rising keep in mind that it take about three week for migrant to make their way from central america to the mexican border with the u s so the border get more porous by the day that’s intentional and the biden administration ha made it that way early indication suggest that this month march will see the largest surge of illegal entry to this country in a generation so who are all these people coming well we don’t really know who they are and we don’t really have a good way to find out and that’s the scariest part in the last day we have learned that at least four people arrested recently at the southern border were identified by law enforcement a quote “known to be or reasonably suspected of being involved in terrorist activity ” well that seems like a front page story but it’s not democrat know perfectly well how unpopular open border are with american american of all race so they are doing their best hysterically in fact to suppress news about what is actually happening here is veronica escobar who somehow got elected to congress from texas letting you know that if you say a single word about what’s happening on the border right now you’re racist begin video clip rep veronica escobar d tx they can either join u in being part of the solution or my fear is what they are going to continue to do is seek way to divide our country fuel xenophobia and racism and i want to warn them that their word and the fueling of that xenophobia that racism that hatred of the border that that fear of the border there are consequence to that language in that rhetoric end video clip carlson “divide the country ” say the people who are letting in million of foreign national who have no right to be here against the will of the population — divide the country it’s interesting to watch a demagogue like that yap into a camera and then compare her to a leader who actually care about the people he represents in our conversation yesterday it wa striking that the president of el salvador took responsibility for the fact that million have left his country el salvador he said need better security and more opportunity and he seemed to mean it a he said it so compare that response to the response from an incompetent like gavin newsom in california or an open race baiter like veronica escobar of texas those kind of people blame white supremacy and qanon for their failure and then they keep going they never look back it’s pathetic joe biden isn’t much better than this biden know the american public doesn’t want a million new poor people showing up illegally this year our country can’t handle that obviously especially not right now again open border are not popular with anyone they’re not popular with hispanic by the way all the guilty white liberal assume hispanic love illegal immigration they don’t they’re american why would they love it now biden is now trying to blame the whole thing on trump of course apparently the promise of a border wall wa a massive lure to central american hoping to sneak in it’s pretty funny but at the same time and not so subtly biden is telling more illegal alien to come here here wa biden on “good morning america” this morning letting the world know that america’s top priority is making foreign national feel comfortable in the united state begin video clip george stephanopoulos abc news host do you have to say quite clearly don’t come joe biden d president of the united state yes i can say quite clearly don’t come over and the process is getting set up and it’s not going to take a whole long time is to be able to apply for asylum in place so don’t leave your town or city or community we’re going to make sure we have facility in those city and town run by dhs and also access with hhs the health and human service to say you can apply for asylum from where you are right now end video clip carlson oh got it so just don’t come yet we’re not quite ready and by the way don’t trouble yourself we’ll come to you we’re going to spend whatever it take to make the whole process easier for you so that more people from your country can move to our country entirely at our expense that’s our promise to the world and we hate ourselves enough that you know we mean it ha any country ever promised something like this to the world can any country survive once it ha joe biden hasn’t thought about that he doesn’t care none of them care all they know is that the democratic party will never lose again once they pull this off and that’s all that matter to them',\n",

the white house they couldn’t be more wrong what’s happening on the southern border is the most preventable emergency in year and joe biden created it no matter how often he tell asylum seeker that now is not the time to enter the united state migrant won’t listen that’s because the policy he put into place incentivize the dangerous trek at the same time biden ha handed the republican an issue

he added “if they do we will not expel that young child ” that includes ten of thousand of teenager who may be looking for job rather than fleeing persecution so the white house say stay put but if

seeker in mexico while their claim were reviewed — and canceling the “safe third country” agreement that required migrant to apply for asylum in the first nation they entered on their way to the

the fence around the u s capitol complete with razor wire still stand biden’s position on the two wall delivers a message to both migrant and citizen but it’s not a consistent message nor is it a

wa delivered daily to biden s home during the transition good morning president elect biden the ad began in giant bold type hope you ll take a few minute this morning to meet a few of the million american struggling with student loan debt we need you to help u build back better by cancelling all federal student loan debt byrne told the new york time that she expected some blowback from the incoming administration but instead found herself welcomed into the fold incoming white house chief of staff ron klain encouraged her to keep pushing and even invited byrne to zoom meeting with the transition team we just kept being able to have people at the table she told the time that showed me that we could do cool thing like sit in and banner drop but we could also be warm and fuzzy byrne s activism didn t yield immediate result a evidenced by the uproar last month over biden s first pronouncement on student debt cancellation a president biden said he wa open to canceling in debt—a relative pittance—but not necessarily the figure both majority leader chuck schumer and sen elizabeth warren of massachusetts have been pushing but the day after biden s response at a cnn town hall jumpstarted the student debt conversation white house press secretary jen psaki said the west wing wa referring the issue to the department of justice to review biden s authority on the matter and what he had the power to do through executive action in previous democratic administration that referral might be seen a a dodge—a way for the administration to find it way to justifying what the president ha already decided to do in this administration it might actually buy time for the white house to come out with a more aggressive stance on the issue than biden held a a candidate or ha even stated a president when first asked in fact on thursday the education department announced it wa cancelling some billion in debt for about borrower who were defrauded by for profit colleges—a life altering change for every one of those borrower but the episode is le instructive a a matter of outcome than it is a a matter of process and an examination of how exactly progressive activist can best influence the biden white house and administration policy over and over again the biden white house ha proven to be pleasantly surprisingly from it progressive posture on day one of the administration to the way biden and his top lieutenant unapologetically pushed through one of the most liberal piece of legislation in generation this week the hit just kept on coming with biden for the first time indicating he wa open to reforming the filibuster so that it requires senator to actually occupy the senate floor and psaki announcing the president support the push for washington d c statehood two month into the biden administration all indication are that it is operating on an entirely different playing field than those of it most recent democratic predecessor not only have biden and his team learned the lesson of the obama administration they also appear to have an entirely different approach to the way they interact with progressive activist a someone who both reported on and watched different progressive movement work to influence the obama white house i have been trying to get a handle on what move team biden—what exactly can liberal activist do to push this administration what i have concluded is that biden is much le bothered by outside agitation than president barack obama wa the obama white house wa actually quite thin skinned about criticism from the left the movement that eventually notched some of the biggest win during the obama administration did so by mounting very persistent and highly visible pressure campaign obama bristled at being heckled by lgbtq activist at a democratic fundraiser in just like he did when he wa challenged by immigration activist at a speech to member of the national council of la raza in july of later that year climate activist linked arm to form a human chain to people deep around the white house all of these action were part of pressure campaign that eventually bore fruit in term of policy change but they also came at the price of enormous effort by grassroots activists—while washington advocate who occasionally spoke out of turn could find themselves frozen out of gaining access to the white house the biden white house seems to be taking the exact opposite tack—inviting activist and advocate alike into the conversation on the way to developing the policy the entire organism is just much le adversarial in nature and also appears to produce more liberal outcome president biden for instance ha placed more than a half dozen warren ally and protégés in his administration in position where they could have a very real impact on policy and regulation of the financial industry one of those appointee julie morgan is a senior adviser at the education department with an expertise in student loan debt according to mother jones julie margetta morgan whom warren call another data nerd like herself spent two year working in the senate digging into the particular of who carry student loan debt what she discovered warren recall wa a job that called for oversight of the education department s administration of the loan program they identified an obscure provision in the higher education act called defense to repayment and pushed the department to wipe out the loan of student defrauded by for profit college which it did in morgan is now focused on loan debt a a senior counsel at the department of education which is in the midst of studying whether that same provision grant the department the authority to do the sort of mass debt cancellation warren ha advocated for the present push to cancel student debt and the early success regarding defrauded student is instructive on a couple of level first change in the biden administration seems to be much more about the conversation than the outside agitation though i hasten to add that grassroots pressure is still essential to creating space for democrat to move left second meaningful change may not arrive in the form of one grand sweeping gesture the way it did with the trillion relief package policy that are deeply transformative for ten of thousand of people—or even hundred of thousand or millions—for example could come in smaller le obvious bite and be spread out in regulatory change across the administration biden s approach to filibuster reform is yet another example of how his understated approach could yield real win even if they don t unfold a we imagined they might instead of pushing to eliminate the filibuster outright biden said this week he wanted a return to what it wa supposed to be —a talking filibuster like it wa when i first got to the senate back in the old day it s brilliant framing actually depriving republican of any number of talking point about the dangerously radical policy of the left this change isn t radical in biden s formulation in fact it s anything but radical—it s a reversion to form biden topped it all off with the most common sense observation possible it s almost getting to the point where democracy is having a hard time functioning he told abc s george stephanopoulos indeed who s talking common sense reform now republican it s still early but by may of i and some of my close ally had already started to conclude the lgbtq movement wa in for a fight and not primarily with republican but just a couple month into the biden administration it feel like the progressive movement ha a partner in the white house joe biden is handling the presidency like a guy who ha nothing to prove which make him both le reactionary and more persuadable in some way that s a function of his whiteness and perhaps more specifically not being the first black man to occupy the oval office which surely carried unimaginable pressure but some of biden s relative ease might also be a function of age some people—though certainly not all—simply grow more comfortable in their skin the older they get whatever the reason biden appears to be a guy who both understands the transformational moment he s living and is open to transformation he s living into the historical moment surrounding him and that ultimately ha the potential to yield the most

       " ('link copied president joe biden can’t expect a lot of cooperation from texas that much ha been made clear by state republicans’ behavior in just the past three month texas attorney general ken paxton led a far fetched federal lawsuit to overturn biden’s victory after that failed he brought a suit against the new administration’s plan to pause immigration deportation only two day into biden’s presidency just day after that texas governor greg abbott issued an executive order pledging to fight biden’s climate change agenda—and when a bitter winter storm knocked out the state’s power abbott erroneously blamed democrat and renewable energy for the crisis for the republican who dominate texas politics biden’s honeymoon ended before he had unpacked all his box in the white house but the leadership in harris county texas the third largest county in the country and home to houston responded to biden’s ascendance with a very different attitude the county’s chief elected official lina hidalgo—a democrat colombian immigrant and year old stanford graduate—views the biden administration a something like the arrival of the cavalry after taking office in hidalgo dealt with a trump administration whose attitude toward the nation’s biggest city and inner suburb ranged from indifference to open hostility the republican ruled state government ha been equally combative in recent year abbott and the legislature have grown more and more assertive in overriding policy from the state’s democratic leaning metropolitan center on monday abbott endorsed legislation that would ban the innovative measures—such a keeping poll open later in the day during the early voting period—that harris county used to expand voter turnout last fall to a year high after year of these headwind hidalgo is eager to work with the biden administration on a range of issue including pandemic recovery expanding access to health care transportation and affordable housing and combatting local flooding linked to climate change republican leader in texas have been “targeting local government a their political tool and it almost seems they keep a to do list of what county and city are doing so they can cancel it out at the next session ” hidalgo one of biden’s host when he recently toured damage from the storm in houston told me “being able to work with someone—anyone—helps ” derek thompson superstar city are in trouble hidalgo’s enthusiasm about working with biden illustrates the president’s opportunity to fundamentally rethink the way the federal government pursues it domestic goal biden could advance both his agenda and his political interest by channeling his policy through major metropolitan area without relying on state a his principal partner a previous white house have traditionally done city and their inner suburb need an immediate lifeline from washington to stabilize their finance after the devastation of the pandemic but once those community regain their balance they could become crucial ally for biden by working with big metro the president would be aligning federal policy with powerful economic social and electoral trends—and empowering local official overwhelmingly sympathetic to his core objective if biden can forge such partnership he could both ignite a new wave of local innovation and solidify the democratic party’s advantage in the fast growing diverse and well educated metro area that have become the bedrock of it electoral coalition “if joe biden could be the president who reclaimed federalism and rewrote federalism for this next generation ” los angeles mayor eric garcetti told me “i think that’s going to be one of his most lasting legacy ” donald trump though himself a native new yorker had little use for city except to condemn them using them a a foil to energize his predominantly nonurban base he not only targeted urban area with inflammatory rhetoric but also assaulted them with policy—including his attempt to cut off federal funding to those that would not fully cooperate with immigration authority and his deployment of federal law enforcement into democratic run city last year over the objection of local official congressional republican few of whom now represent urban voter were no warmer in negotiation on a covid relief plan last year for example then–senate majority leader mitch mcconnell blocked additional aid to state and local government whose budget had been ravaged by the pandemic thus pressuring them to cut key service the trump administration didn’t communicate much with local government garcetti said “and worse than that obviously what they’ve communicated—whether it’s mcconnell or others—is drop dead ” biden ha a very different history his political career began five decade ago in local government when he won a seat on the new castle county council in northern delaware a vice president he worked closely with mayor while implementing the economic recovery plan that barack obama signed into law in he ha selected three current or former mayor for his cabinet pete buttigieg at the department of transportation marcia fudge at the department of housing and urban development and marty walsh at the department of labor biden made one of his first postelection appearance before the advocacy group the national league of city where he insisted that cooperation with urban area would be crucial to his success on the biggest challenge he face including the pandemic and racial and economic inequality “american city are on the front line of all of these crisis ” biden said related story revenge of the suburb democrat have a republican woman problem how democrat conquered the city democrats’ only chance to stop the gop assault on voting right democratic president almost always express some version of that sentiment but biden ha good reason to translate it into a genuine reassessment of how the federal government implement it domestic policy any president who want to accelerate economic recovery widen the circle of opportunity close the racial wealth gap reduce carbon emission and rethink the country’s education system must recognize that city and their inner suburb are the principal arena in which those effort will succeed or fail on most issues—whether it’s health care infrastructure or education—the federal government’s default position for decade ha been to work with state not city or county this approach ha typically seemed logical america ha only state compared with more than city and town and more than county but in many way that strategy now seems anachronistic especially for a democratic president the most obvious reason is that in this highly polarized era the state controlled by republican governor or legislators—currently slightly more than half of all the states—are hostile to almost everything a democratic president want to do in the most consequential recent example red state were conspicuously slower than blue state to expand medicaid to more of the working poor following the passage of the affordable care act eleven year after the aca became law state with republican controlled legislature most of them also with republican governor still haven’t done so during obama’s presidency coalition of red state many of them organized by texas filed a series of lawsuit to block the administration’s agenda on immigration health care climate and other concern texas’s success at winning a nationwide injunction against biden’s immigration enforcement policy le than a week after his inauguration show that the new president can expect more of the same far from partnering with biden red state are much more likely to fight him using every tool at their disposal relying on state a partner also ignores the increasing economic importance of the big metro area particularly in the growing knowledge based economy since the late th century when many city seemed to be facing terminal decline “we’ve had a radical economic restructuring ” say bruce katz a former hud chief of staff and now a distinguished fellow at drexel university’s lindy institute for urban innovation “what the market is rewarding all over the world is metropolitan concentration and agglomeration ” the largest u s county now account for more than half of the nation’s total economic output nearly half of it job and more than two fifth of the total population—measurable increase from according to tabulation provided to me by the brookings institution’s metropolitan policy program additionally about three fifth of nonwhite american and more than two third of the country’s immigrant live in just those largest county targeting metro area a the principal partner for federal action would also acknowledge the rapidly evolving electoral landscape from the s through the ’s urban politics wa defined by endemic conflict between inner city which were largely minority community and tilted democratic and their suburb which were filled with republican leaning white flight family but over roughly the past year and especially during the trump era a different dividing line ha emerged economic opportunity especially in the digital economy have attracted more white people back to central city and suburb have diversified with the migration of more black latino and asian american family economic tie between central city and their surrounding suburb have solidified the result more and more city and their inner suburb find their interest converging—while those interest simultaneously diverge from the conservative priority of the mostly white people living in small town and rural place away from urban center a november’s presidential result demonstrated if you draw an imaginary beltway around almost any major metropolitan area democrat are growing stronger inside that circle while republican are consolidating their position outside of it tabulation by the daily yonder a website focusing on rural issue found that biden not only won the county anchored by the nation’s biggest urban center by a crushing million vote but also carried their inner suburb by more than million and even won midsize urban center by million or so those three category of community provided almost four fifth of all biden’s vote trump dominated the smaller place beyond those center but that wasn’t nearly enough for him to overcome biden’s advantage in the metro area read trump’s parting gift to joe biden the political convergence between city and inner suburb would multiply the impact of any biden partnership with local leader he ha the chance to build alliances—and thus extend policies—across entire metropolitan region achieving greater scale than he could by working with central city alone “regionalism becomes much more realistic today than it ever wa before ” julián castro the hud secretary under obama and a former mayor of san antonio told me this convergence also underscore another reason for biden to channel his agenda through metropolitan area most of them are already moving in the direction he want to go because trump and the previous republican congress treated city and their inner suburb with such hostility many were forced to develop their own capacity to respond to a broad range of domestic challenge that in the past they might have left to state or federal official city still have plenty of problem but in the cold wind of the trump year the best of them grew more creative about nurturing new approach and building new coalition that engage business labor and philanthropy for region wide solution “it’s not just that these urban county … are home to the bulk of the nation’s economy and represent the future ” say amy liu the vice president and director of brookings’s metropolitan policy program mpp “it’s that these place are more likely to come up with the innovative solution that are going to put the u s back into global leadership ” this mean that on almost any domestic issue biden care about he doesn’t have to start from scratch hundred of mayor and county executive such a garcetti and hidalgo are already attempting to accomplish many of the same goals—and they are eager for federal help that could scale their effort although biden’s agenda may provoke opposition from the majority of republican governor and state legislator this army of largely democratic local official provides him with “a coalition of the willing ” a mark muro the mpp’s policy director put it garcetti who ha worked to organize mayor on climate transportation and other issue agrees “i think that we have definitely increased our capacity ” he said “but we haven’t given up on the idea that washington will be a partner ” biden may have the greatest opportunity to partner with city on the problem that he’s described a the “no issue facing humanity” and an “existential threat” global climate change despite his strong word biden face structural political constraint that could prevent him from responding sufficiently to the problem in congress the prospect of meaningful legislative action is virtually precluded by what i’ve called “the brown blockade” the tendency of the state most reliant on the fossil fuel economy to elect republican opposed to any effort to reduce carbon emission biden may respond to that legislative stalemate by imposing tough climate regulation through the environmental protection agency but the conservative majority on the supreme court could block him there too—just a it sided with mostly red state to bar some of obama’s emission regulation on power plant partnership with city offer biden his best way out of this box with trump undoing almost all of obama’s federal effort to fight climate change hundred of mayor committed to meeting the goal of the paris agreement and reducing greenhouse gas emission through organization such a america’s pledge and climate mayor brookings recently reported that of the nation’s largest city have established specific commitment for reducing their greenhouse gas emission and another have set more general reduction goal the municipal organizing during the trump year established “some really important groundwork ” antha williams the global head of climate and environment at bloomberg philanthropy told me “we have a bunch of leader who have now run their political race on climate change and won and now we are pivoting to what ha to be the time for action ” biden ha many option for boosting cities’ climate effort in way that advance his own goal he could start by helping them transition their transportation fleet to electric vehicle biden laid down a bold marker in his first week a president when he said that he wanted to replace the federal government’s entire vehicle fleet with fully electric options—a way of using washington’s purchasing power to turbocharge the market for electric vehicle but biden can virtually double his reach by nudging municipal government to electrify too according to bloomberg’s calculation they have a combined fleet that’s nearly a large about vehicle some local government are moving on their own to integrate more electric vehicle but progress ha been slow and supply simply isn’t available right now for some of the vehicle that city want to electrify such a school and transit bus federal grant to city to buy electric vehicle could speed up the transition “there’s a bottleneck with manufacturer who are saying ‘there’s not the market so we’re not making them ’” williams said “cities are saying ‘we can’t buy them because they don’t exist ’” “having the signal that the market’s going to be there because the weight of the federal government is behind it make a really big difference ” she added rethinking energy usage in building also a biden priority could be another shared goal lauren faber o’connor los angeles’s chief sustainability officer say the federal government ha a huge opportunity to cut emission and add job by giving city money to undertake energy efficiency retrofit in public and private structure “every building in the country is basically a shovel ready project ” she told me electricity generation offer yet another chance for partnership a castro pointed out to me biden want to require all utility public and private to generate percent of their electricity from zero carbon source by while such a mandate face difficult odds of surviving congress or the court many municipally owned utility would voluntarily enlist in such a crusade castro predicts they have been “much more willing than investor owned utility to invest in renewable energy and take on green economy initiative ” he said biden also ha huge opportunity to partner with city to more broadly rethink policy around transportation now the single largest source of u s carbon emission almost all federal transportation money is now distributed through state producing frustration in urban area that too much funding go to building road and highways—especially in rural areas—rather than to mass transit project in recent year “roads were being paved that had more cow walking on them than people driving on them ” former philadelphia mayor michael nutter now a professor of practice at columbia university’s school of international and public affair told me “the money get used for political chit that governor need ” in houston hidalgo’s fight with the state over a crucial transportation project is an example of counties’ and cities’ funding struggle she’s engaged in a lengthy but fruitless effort to redirect transportation money from a planned expansion of interstate through the center of the city toward greater investment in mass transit option which are few in houston “we’ve tried so hard a the city and the county to get them to modify this i expansion ” hidalgo said noting that the county hired a rice university expert to develop an alternative plan “but they are just unwilling ” the state planning board that control the decision is “set up to increase the power of the nonurban area ” to hidalgo this is precisely the sort of anti metro impulse in red state that the biden administration could combat since the highway project is being funded largely with federal money “i’m hoping that a biden administration that is committed to modern and effective transportation might … step in and say ‘look why do we need to keep building this kind of highway that really nobody want and hurt on so many other issues—including by the way encouraging the housing sprawl that cause u to flood ’” she said beyond houston city across the country are trying to reduce residents’ long term dependence on car even in the ultimate car city los angeles voter approved a visionary ballot measure in that will raise billion over the succeeding year to fund mass transit improvement through a permanent increase in the sale tax the next year garcetti founded an organization accelerator for america that ha worked with other city to pas their own similar ballot measure yusef robb a senior adviser at accelerator for america told me that los angeles’s experience offer one model for biden to reimagine federal transportation program providing matching grant to city and metro area that raise their own money for transit initiative such an approach could also benefit rural community he said if metro area raise their own tax to partially fund transit improvement that would free up more federal dollar for nonurban place with a smaller tax base read biden’s stimulus is a big deal for public transit mass transit investment is only one example of how washington could rethink transportation in partnership with big metro shouldn’t a st century transportation plan also fund denser development especially around transit hub to reduce the need to commute at all robb asked shouldn’t it examine how to better connect those hub through greener option such a scooter bicycle ride share and electric vehicle or why not explore what garcetti call an even more radical idea free mass transit “it would help get people out of car it would help get ridership back” after the pandemic garcetti said adding that l a is studying the idea if the federal government gave the city money for a pilot program it could “double the number of people taking transit because it wa free or very very low cost for most people ” he said that would have significant environmental and economic justice impact and could encourage industry to produce greener transportation option garcetti said “there’s a whole virtuous cycle in this ” the biggest change available to biden cut across the full range of domestic policy nothing would contribute more to a new federalism than preventing red state governor and legislature from standing in between biden and the metro area sympathetic to his goal the past decade’s experience with the affordable care act crystallizes the problem in the red state that have refused to expand medicaid many local official in the largest city and county might welcome the opportunity to cover more of the uninsured under current law though county and city can only partner with washington to expand medicaid if their governor agrees to forward their application say cindy mann who ran the center for medicare and medicaid service under obama in most if not all red state republican governor would likely block such federal local partnership but a democratic controlled congress could change the aca to allow local government to bypass those governors—and even to make such partnership more financially feasible for the locale by providing them with enhanced federal funding authorizing local government to expand coverage directly would make a big dent in access to health care since most of the uninsured in those red state live in urban areas—the five biggest texas county for instance account for nearly half of the state’s uninsured and a law empowering local government to expand medicaid might be easier to pas through congress than an alternative biden ha already floated automatically enrolling eligible american in the non expansion state into a new “public option ” the principle of allowing city and county to circumvent hostile governor could provide the cornerstone for this new federalism the sweeping immigration reform bill biden proposed in late february gesture in this direction it includes a small pilot program to allow city or county facing a population squeeze to directly petition the federal government to obtain new green card for immigrant willing to settle there biden could apply that instinct more powerfully by allowing city and county to participate even if their state refuse to in any new funding stream he establishes such a money for universal pre k and expanded child care program or even his call for tuition free community college during his two term a president obama took some initial step toward allying the federal government more directly with local government the former president created an especially valuable model through a set of program that required local government to compete for federal grant by assembling coalition of local business educational institution and philanthropy he applied that approach most prominently to the “race to the top” educational grant that provided new dollar to district that committed to sweeping reform he also made city compete to host new advanced manufacturing research center although only a handful of applicant ever won funding in either of those competition many community found that just convening all the local player behind a shared vision spurred fresh thinking and new initiative the mpp’s liu and other expert in urban policy note biden could build on that precedent many of those expert told me by incorporating into his plan funding incentive for city to work with their surrounding county “inducements for cooperation could be a really transformative thing ” say brook rainwater the director of the national league of cities’ center for city solution “in the same way the politics is converging within broader metro area the economy really have converged in the last couple of decade you could really see the federal government encourage that ” promoting such regionalism would reflect the reality of how problem are actually solved—or not—in today’s economy it would also advance the democrats’ political goal of encouraging inner suburb already trending toward them in the trump era to see their interest a aligned with those of central city that process of strengthening a sense of shared purpose could reach far beyond the government toward a much broader range of local constituency “what i see is a coalition of business civic and philanthropic leader around the country committing to a set of national goal through local action ” liu told me “i could imagine ceo circle with mayor in different part of the country committing to drive those goal in those region and the federal government could easily align their resource to help region meet their goal ” washington’s role in this new federalism doesn’t need to be limited to writing check biden could also advance his agenda by pushing local government to adopt policy consistent with his priority the president for instance ha endorsed a minimum wage and mandatory paid leave for illness or family need such a the birth of a child save for what he’s able to shoehorn into the special budget “reconciliation” process that can clear the senate with just a majority vote he is unlikely to pas those measure through congress but some local government have already adopted those policy and biden could extend them to million of more worker by campaigning to win them approval in more city either through personal appearance or by dispatching his cabinet secretary “there is a groundswell of urban policy experimentation on the wage and labor sector that could be supported on the national level ” rainwater told me with biden’s emphasis on fostering national unity his instinct likely will be to search for way to disperse economic growth more widely into small town and rural area where republican dominate his chief of staff ronald klain spent the past few year working for the aol founder steve case’s investment fund to encourage more venture capital financing in midsize and smaller city spreading the wealth around would fulfill a real need the growing concentration of economic activity into a few superstar city ha left everyone frustrated people living outside those golden circle feel deprived of opportunity and those within them feel crushed by traffic soaring housing price and neighborhood displacement by showing the possibility of remote work and the potential risk of density the pandemic might encourage more people to move farther away from crowded metropolitan area read a cold war between red and blue america yet on both economic and political ground it would be a mistake for biden to divert his attention too much from the largest metropolitan area even if some remote worker flee big city rent the underlying trend in the information age economy that reward the concentration of talent investment and idea in dense metro area show no sign of slackening city and their inner suburb are likely to remain america’s driving engine of economic innovation racial and religious diversity and population growth america’s biggest challenge from social inequality to racial equity to climate change will either get solved in those large metro area or they won’t get solved at all',\n",

not much time to make it he can adhere to the deal negotiate an extension or abandon the trump administration’s framework altogether and start from scratch—prolonging the now two decade long war that a majority of american want to end according to a poll conducted across december and january by yougov and the pro withdrawal group concerned veteran for america for will ruger a charles koch institute official who ha become one of the more prominent advocate in washington for a total withdrawal there isn’t much of a choice “president biden ha to choose between mr trump’s withdrawal and mr biden’s war ” ruger wrote in a new york time op ed late last month “the right choice is obvious ” within biden’s cabinet the decision is not so clear cut and many observer expect him to keep at least some u troop in the country one potential solution floated in a pair of biden administration document that leaked recently is the creation of a temporary government with power shared between the taliban and u backed afghan leader such a deal would unmoor biden from the timeline adopted by trump and leave open the possibility of some troop remaining in afghanistan for a longer period of time ruger known for his longtime affiliation with the charles koch institute and the koch backed stand together movement is no one’s idea of a green party activist or an antiwar critic the closest he ha ever come to serving in a high level government role came when trump tapped him to be ambassador to afghanistan last year the nomination expired following the election but it boosted his profile at a time when progressive democrat and restraint minded republican were already becoming more successful at bucking the traditional interventionist view of foreign policy that ha long been ascendant in washington dc “i think we’ll all sleep well at night knowing american will no longer be killed in battle in afghanistan ” with ruger’s urging and due to a coalition of antiwar group allied with stand together congress passed a historic set of war power resolution aimed at curbing the president’s ability to declare war on iran or have the military assist with saudi arabia’s war in yemen trump vetoed both piece of legislation but their level of support signified a coming sea change in the foreign policy conversation biden’s decision on afghanistan is now the latest test case for how far the antiwar movement will be able to push it agenda it is a moment ruger and his ally do not plan to squander “the biden administration ha been handed a gift by the trump administration because on the politics side president biden can essentially say ‘i’m sticking to this deal ” ruger told me “and then the inevitable messiness that obviously will occur in any war termination scenario he can blame on president trump on ambassador khalilzad hell he can blame me but i think we’ll all sleep well at night knowing american will no longer be killed in battle in afghanistan ” in the washington foreign policy circle where ruger ha made himself most known his view are no secret despite being a navy reservist who deployed to afghanistan from to ruger approach foreign policy with the analytical lens of a political science professor—which he wa for eight year at texas state university after joining the koch network in and beginning to coordinate it foreign policy portfolio he became a near omnipresent force among the washington antiwar caucus through constant op ed panel discussion and off the record dinner with journalist and expert with his wire rim glass and professorial disposition he would fit easily inside the blob—washington speak for the professional foreign policy thinker who believe in an expansive u role in the world—save for one problem he share none of it view “we have not had a healthy marketplace of idea in the foreign policy space ” ruger told politico last year “there should be no opprobrium given to people’s desire to find a diplomatic arrangement to avoid or end conflict ” even though ruger’s institutional affiliation often aligns him with libertarian minded conservative his staunchest ally on foreign policy often come from across the aisle at a panel discussion last year he praised progressive rep ro khanna d calif who co chaired bernie sanders’ presidential campaign for being one of the “political leader across the spectrum stepping up” for the american who loathe the waste of “blood and treasure” abroad during the discussion khanna and ruger took turn dismissing an argument by david petraeus the retired general who led u force in iraq and afghanistan that the u commitment to remain in afghanistan wa a necessary way to fight terrorism “i just see the world very differently and i’m guessing you do too ” ruger told khanna there is no better evidence of the strange alliance that sprout up around foreign policy than the one george soros and charles koch formed in the wealthy donor share little in common except for the mutual enmity of their respective follower but that year they joined together to fund the quincy institute for responsible statecraft a think tank that employ non interventionist scholar from across the political spectrum quincy’s online magazine responsible statecraft regularly publishes contribution from progressive group like win without war and the nonpartisan watchdog project on government oversight ruger ha no formal affiliation with quincy but he spoke at one of their conference and ha co written piece with quincy fellow rajan menon “the value of these alliance ha been clear they translate into bipartisan vote in congress ” erica fein advocacy director at win without war told me “we may not agree on what world we want to ultimately see but we work together with clear eye about where our value don’t align ” quincy is a visible outgrowth of the antiwar movement’s growing influence but also a symbol of something the movement ha long lacked money since the end of concerned veteran for

majority of american support trump’s deal to extricate the united state from afghanistan by may including nearly percent of biden supporter according to a eurasia group poll commissioned in september ruger think that sentiment applies to the ruling class too even a president from both party have continued to keep a u military presence in afghanistan a a bulwark against the taliban resuming control “there is a sense pretty broadly in washington that these endless war seem to be dragging on there doesn’t seem to be a lot of value in staying and that maybe we might want to turn a corner so we can focus on the rise of china and these domestic priority ” ruger said during the trump era cva frequently partnered with left leaning group to push in favor of withdrawal and more recently the koch

conducted the war some u and afghan official fear that ending it could be worse in a recent interview with the new yorker afghan vice president amrullah saleh suggested that a faulty peace deal could renew a level of violence that afghanistan ha not seen in decade “people will not accept the taliban ” he said “it will be another civil war”—worse than the one that “killed more than fifty thousand people” in the s the afghanistan study group a group of former military leader lawmaker and expert commissioned by congress to study the impact of a peace agreement with the taliban similarly concluded in a report last month that a withdrawal in may “will likely lead to a collapse of the afghan state and a possible renewed civil war ” the group recommended a conditional withdrawal that could keep the united state mired in central asia indefinitely gen joe dunford the former chairman of the joint chief and one of the report’s co chair even said the existing amount of troop might not be enough to ward off the taliban “in the fall what we were told by commander on the ground in the department of defense wa that u force in addition to the nato force that are there wa the minimum level to address both the mission a well a protection of our force ” he told congress last month “so in our judgment would not be adequate should the taliban re initiate attack against the united state ” though the pentagon ha publicly said there are u troop in afghanistan the new york time reported earlier this week “that number is actually around ” if biden renege on the previous

       " ('in the aftermath of the passage of the american relief plan republican are caught in a swirl of regret and recrimination president joe biden s trillion package which tackle the twin problem of ending the pandemic and relieving the economic pain it s caused is incredibly popular with the public it enjoys approval from not just a large majority of american but a plurality of republican voter a well a huge part of the reason why ha been the lack of effort from well heeled conservative group to seed grassroots opposition through their usual astroturfing method this wait and see approach ha baffled some gop luminary and trump world figure who expected republican to seize their first opportunity to cast newly in charge democrat a out of control report politico adding that the party did little to dent biden s major victory steve bannon donald trump s former advisor who wa recently arrested on charge of defrauding gullible conservative with a fake border wall group ha complained about the lack of response to this bill in an organized messaging and aggressive medium push back it is a little puzzling especially in light of what happened in when then president barack obama saw an uprising of rage dubbed the tea party first against his economic relief bill and then against the affordable care act this time around there s a curious dearth of angry white people clad in cargo short and tricorner hat hitting the street to wave incoherent cardboard sign considering how much enthusiasm there wa on the right for the outright overthrowing of the government through violence just a couple of month ago this meh reaction to biden s bill is a bit surprising blame the republican addiction to donald trump in the past five year the gop morphed from a real political party that had a platform to a personality cult built around a failed businessman a party whose only platform wa do whatever dear leader say is his whim today now trump ha retreated to mar a lago having failed at his effort to steal the election or incite a coup to overthrow the government and he is way more interested in trying to reroute donor money from republican to his own pocket than he is getting involved in an organized effort to oppose biden s economic and pandemic rescue plan in there wa a multitude of conservative group many of them funded by the koch brother on hand to coordinate a response to obama s economic rescue plan they understood that the gop base wasn t actually interested in small government but they were able to tap into the racism that actually animates the base telling supporter a fake story about how obama s american recovery and reinvestment act wa just a cover for the federal government to give free house away to black and latino people quite literally tea party group were selling honk if i m paying your mortgage bumper sticker premised on this deeply racist and false narrative that racism wa then channeled into the opposition to the affordable care act a these same astroturf group seeded lie about thing like death panel meant to scare aging white people into believing their health care would be taken away and given to younger more racially diverse american it s the same crap republican have been pulling for decade channeling the energy of racist towards the goal of the economic elite to keep their own tax and regulation low now however trump ha captured the loyalty of that group of racist white american who make up the gop base more importantly he cut out the middleman by embracing an overt form of racism that s more appealing than the coded dog whistle of the past the more traditional form of gop politics where racism ha to be sublimated into movement that pretend to be about small government like the tea party just can t compete so while trump is gone for now the party is still organized around trump and his particular obsession especially his anger over losing the election and his rather unsubtle narrative characterizing voter in city like philadelphia atlanta and detroit a illegal and fraudulent republican donor and conservative activist don t have the energy to fight against biden s agenda because they re focused on relitigating the election and embracing trump s desire to punish and marginalize those who voted against him especially those democratic voter who are black the new york time report american for prosperity the political organization funded by the koch fortune is not supporting the effort to pas more ballot access law nor are other group in the multimillion dollar koch political network american for prosperity wa the main organization behind the grassroots tea party and they are focused on using their might a they did in the obama year to resist the legislative agenda of a democratic president but the base isn t along for the ride a they were back then because backing trump s war on black voter is more interesting to them than resisting biden s legislative agenda to be clear the threat to voting right are extremely serious a heather digby parton explains at salon it s crucial that democrat pas a voting right bill or they very well may find themselves left never winning national election again but it is also no surprise that it s hard for republican to muster much enthusiasm to fight biden s legislative agenda when they are so focused on pursuing the trump set priority of waging war on voting right a igor derysh reported earlier this week the two republican in congress who have done the best job of associating themselves with trump s attempted coup — sen josh hawley of missouri and rep marjorie taylor greene of georgia — have also been raking in the dough from donor a derysh explained in friday s standing room only newsletter this show how a growingly extremist republican base is spliting from corporate pac and big donor that are le interested in trump centric politics the trump addiction of the gop is a double edged sword to be sure on one hand a biden and the democrat are discovering it ha drained the republican base of interest in pursuing goal such a resisting the american rescue plan that aren t set by trump it s created a real opportunity for democrat to push through a bunch of legislation if they could just get rid of the filibuster without facing much opposition from the right still trump s anger at losing the election ha focused republican on a war on voting that could very well destroy democracy itself if democrat don t do more to save it if republican are successful at gutting democracy and turning the federal

crisis engulfing the united state the risk of an early political backlash for biden are growing former president donald trump dispatched his deputy to the hill on wednesday to lobby against biden’s immigration overhaul and trump plan to blast those change in a speech at the conservative political action conference on sunday ad ad an immigration and custom enforcement email obtained by the washington post show that the administration ha already entered crisis mode on the southern border “we need to prepare for border surge now ” timothy perry ice’s new chief of staff wrote in a feb email “we need to begin making change immediately ” the biden administration is so worried about running out of shelter space for teenager and child who cross the border without their parent that shelter have been authorized to purchase airplane ticket and cover other transportation cost for minor whose relative are already living in the united state according to an email from the department of health and human services’ office of refugee resettlement — which run the shelter — that wa obtained by the post ad hhs confirmed the policy change late wednesday ad the white house ha yet to announce a nominee for the director of ice or a commissioner for u s custom and border protection the two most important immigration enforcement job building pressure at the border haven’t stopped biden from reversing trump’s policy on wednesday the white house dumped a trump order that shut the door to visa holder and other legal immigrant on the ground that their arrival would hurt the u s labor market under strain from the coronavirus pandemic the new administration notched a fleeting breakthrough this week when advocate for immigrant agreed to stand down on several crucial lawsuit involving migrant family and unaccompanied child giving the administration more day to put new policy in place ad “the word i would preach here is patience ” said j kevin appleby a board member at the hope border institute an immigrant aid organization in el paso “everyone expects automatic result and automatic change but it’s going to take time to reverse what trump did ” biden’s election victory drew cheer from migrant stranded in squalid freezing refugee camp in mexico and some rushed across a bridge in the border city of el paso while chanting his name unlike trump — whose tough talk of an immigration crackdown led to record low border crossing in his first month in office — biden ha arrived a the number are rising and because the trump administration issued a public health order effectively blocking migrant from crossing into the united state biden inherited an infrastructure ill prepared to handle a big influx in the middle of the pandemic federal agent have taken into custody more than migrant a month for each of the past four month the most for that period in at least year ad ad a federal lawsuit last year highlighted how quickly the border situation can shift in november u s district judge emmet g sullivan in the district of columbia blocked the previous administration from immediately expelling child and teenager who arrived at the southern border without their parent a trio of trump appointed appeal court judge in the d c circuit overturned him in january but the ruling backed biden into an uncomfortable corner forced to make the choice biden said he would not resume expelling minor since then the number of minor in federal custody ha more than tripled to prompting official to reopen an overflow shelter in texas to house them — even though the shelter is not state licensed a required — until official can place them with a parent or guardian in the united state ad ad some democrat deplored the move calling for the abolition of ice and the hhs warehouselike influx shelter “this is not okay never ha been okay never will be okay — no matter the administration or party ” rep alexandria ocasio cortez d n y tweeted “we should not go in this direction again ” said julián castro the former presidential candidate and housing secretary during the obama administration but an influx of migrant family — who have far outnumbered unaccompanied child — could create an even more dire situation for the department of homeland security because they are difficult to house during immigration processing and their case have clogged the immigration court dhs hit a “breaking point” in fiscal — when more than migrant family presented themselves at the southern border a record high unaccompanied minor also hit a record that year numbering although immigration agent swiftly deport single adult from the border the latest dhs statistic show that family and child who are allowed into the united state are virtually guaranteed to stay at least a few year ad ad of the more than million migrant who arrived a part of family group between and mid just percent have been returned home while percent have been granted asylum or some form of legal status dhs data show of the remaining percent whose legal claim remain unresolved percent had case pending in u s court while percent have received deportation order or an offer of voluntary departure the statistic show behind the scene the administration ha made clear in email and court record that it is gearing up for a much broader influx at the border the tone of the feb email that perry sent senior ice official wa urgent ad dhs secretary alejandro mayorkas told senior official “to prepare for border surge now ” perry wrote “we need to begin making change immediately we should privilege action over cost consideration do what is needed and the department will work on funding afterward ” ad according to perry’s email which wa first reported by the washington time mayorkas want to “reduce pressure on the border” by getting ice to help transport migrant northward so they can be processed and released official have also been negotiating with advocate for immigrant to stall lawsuit that official fear could have triggered a new border surge the talk put biden administration official in the awkward position of having to defend a trump order under title of the public health code that allows them to expel migrant from the southern border in recent court filing they called the expulsion authority a critical tool in preventing the spread of the coronavirus ad their worry persuaded the aclu to agree to a month long extension in the fight to stop the expulsion of migrant family ad biden administration official also persuaded lawyer representing minor in a federal consent decree known a the flores settlement agreement to give them a month before pushing for a new ruling in that case white house press secretary jen psaki said wednesday that official are working quickly to move minor away from the border and are treating them humanely but she said the administration cannot legally release unaccompanied child to unvetted adult a past practice that ha led to abuse she said the child are being transferred from cramped border station — where some remained longer than the typical hour in recent day because of a major winter storm in texas — to shelter run by hhs “this is a difficult situation and it’s a difficult choice ” she said “that’s the choice we’ve made ” a border influx could imperil the biden administration’s effort to pas an immigration bill this year focused on legalizing million undocumented immigrant — many of whom have lived in the united state for year even decade ad stephen miller — the architect of trump’s immigration strategy — briefed gop lawmaker this week on the biden administration’s immigration change and urged them to continue hammering away at the issue which he said could help republican in the midterm election next year miller told them that the democrats’ midterm defeat were the result of president barack obama focusing on health care reform instead of economic issue “if you think obama focusing on health care during the recession wa a misalignment of priority that is nothing compared to opening america’s border and shutting down enforcement during an economically ravaging pandemic ” miller said in an interview “from a purely political standpoint this is a recipe for democrat to have an historic drubbing in the midterm if we can make it even a big an issue or bigger than obamacare ” cecilia muñoz a

department of homeland security late in the trump administration that agreement required homeland security to consult with texas and other state before taking any action to “reduce redirect reprioritize relax or in any way modify immigration enforcement ” the biden administration argued in court filing that the agreement is unenforceable because “an outgoing administration cannot contract away that power for an incoming administration ” paxton’s office meanwhile submitted a fox news opinion article a evidence that “refusal to remove illegal alien is directly leading to the immediate release of additional illegal alien in texas ” advertisement tipton a trump appointee wrote that his order wa not based on the agreement between texas and the trump administration but federal law to preserve the “status quo” before the dhs moratorium paxton ha championed conservative and far right cause in court including a failed lawsuit seeking to overturn biden’s victory over trump a he himself face an fbi investigation over accusation by top former aide that he abused his office at the service of a donor full coverage immigration in response to the order paxton tweeted

liberty union of texas criticized paxton and argued his lawsuit shouldn’t be allowed to proceed “the administration’s pause on deportation is not only lawful but necessary to ensure that family are not separated and people are not returned to danger needlessly while the new administration review past action ” huddleston said in a statement',\n",

commission chair mary jo white out and she wanted her out immediately over the course of page and footnote in an october letter to president barack obama warren excoriated white for—among other transgressions—using sec resource to push an anti disclosure initiative “cooked up by big business lobbyist ” that wa the last straw in a yearslong clash between the massachusetts senator a ferocious critic of wall street and white who had defended bank a a private attorney never mind that obama had just three month left in his term and a week after the november election white would announce her own departure white’s “brazen conduct ” warren told obama had undermined congress his administration the sec and the investor it serf “enough is enough ” warren wrote white wa just one in a long line of obama appointed financial regulator who incurred warren’s wrath she’d been incensed by the revolving door between the bank and federal government ever since she wa a law professor studying personal bankruptcy at harvard that same revolving door had kept warren from running the consumer financial protection bureau the agency she’d created because bank sympathetic democrat and republican alike worried what such a strident critic would do a it head instead she settled for helping to launch the agency before returning home to massachusetts but over the past four year warren’s standing ha shifted and her view have earned a hard fought place of respect within her party warren likely won’t clash a much with the next sec chair pending senate confirmation biden nominated gary gensler a former investment banker and commodity future trading commission chair who ha become an unlikely but loyal ideological ally for warren and the people who helped to advance warren’s argument have earned their place too bharat ramamurti her former top economic policy hand who helped craft those letter against white’s sec is now a deputy director of the national economic council the white house’s nerve center for economic policymaking ramamurti is far from the lone warren acolyte who ha landed a prime job now that biden is president the administration ha also tapped a number of her first hire to the cfpb such a rohit chopra a likeminded progressive who ha been named to lead the agency some of her former senate aide have been appointed to key role across the federal agency such a julie siegel who helped develop warren’s aggressive private equity proposal and now hold a top post at treasury others have decamped to job at health and human service the national security council and the education department over her eight year in the senate warren ha mentored a fleet of former staffer who now hold role in the biden administration a peak expression of her mantra of “personnel is policy ” and despite the fact that she didn’t win the presidency she is having a tremendous influence on how the biden administration will operate “i can do so much a a senator ” she tell me “but the people who’ve come from my office will be able to do so much more far more ” gene sperling a former nec chair under obama and one of the economist who advised warren on her campaign’s central wealth tax proposal recall warren describing the senate’s lever of power a a tier system the first level is using the platform to change the political debate the second is pushing legislation and the third is “fighting in the trench at every level ” work that requires getting deep in the legislative and regulatory weed “she know that everyone push hard on the second level ” sperling said “but that she could have a uniquely powerful impact by fully throwing herself into the first and third level a well ” a the leader of a congressional panel overseeing congress’ billion bank bailout in the harvard law professor turned a toothless committee into a massive platform for her plainspoken explanation of how the government had abetted a financial system rigged in favor of the few when she spent a year setting up the consumer financial protection bureau in warren emphasized “talent and culture ” a former obama official told politico when she entered the senate instead of becoming the cfpb’s first chair warren decided to keep focusing on building up a network of ally by hiring the right people to be her staff “i thought about ‘what are all the resource available to a senator to make change ’” warren say “one of the important thing is the chance to build a team ” she hired a number of people who had unconventional resume and no congressional experience including former student from her harvard law school class such a ganesh sitaraman who also served a an adviser on her presidential campaign and dan geldon who eventually served a chief of staff to both her senate office and campaign “part of our agenda wa about pushing bill but also getting the executive branch to do more and do better ” recall jeremy bearer friend a professor at george washington university law school who led warren’s tax work from through “that meant spending a lot of time thinking through the pitfall inside agency why thing were moving slowly and pressing them to do more ” those who rose through warren’s rank proved themselves a highly trained professional a thirsty for “blood and teeth left on the floor” a their boss—and shared her penchant for digging into the detail to pave the way for change ramamurti warren’s former banking counsel now at the nec played a lead role in preparing warren’s infamous excoriation of former well fargo ceo john stumpf in over the bank’s fake customer account scandal her cross examination is best remembered for it vitriolic one liners—she pointedly told him he “should resign”—but it wa just one of many tactic ramamurti and his colleague deployed to force regulator to take action the effort led to the resignation of not only stumpf but also his successor tim sloan and finally penalty from the sec and federal reserve julie margetta morgan whom warren call “another data nerd” like herself spent two year working in the senate digging into the particular of who carry student loan debt what she discovered warren recall wa “a job that called for oversight” of the education department’s administration of the loan program they identified an obscure provision in the higher education act called “defense to repayment ” and pushed the department to wipe out the loan of student defrauded by for profit college which it did in morgan is now focused on loan debt a a senior counsel at the department of education which is in the midst of studying whether that same provision grant the department the authority to do the sort of mass debt cancellation warren ha advocated for both morgan and ramamurti declined to comment for this story beyond hiring the “smartest most aggressive people” she can the former professor still see herself a a mentor “my job while they’re in the senate office is to help them sharpen their tool so when they leave they’ll be more effective ” warren tell me noting she’s deliberate in “help ing them find the next job so they can make a difference ” sometimes that includes helping them find a new role in government—a place where they can showcase their skill in warren pushed her fellow senate democrat to tap chopra to serve on the federal trade commission where he championed anti trust policy and last april when congress created another congressional oversight panel in the wake of yet another financial crisis then–senate minority leader chuck schumer nominated ramamurti “she realizes that if you’re going to get a big job you need to show you have experience in governing and politics ” sperling say “she encourages her people to get into position where they can grow from where they can get a track record for getting stuff done ” during the obama year warren torpedoed nec chair larry summers’ expected ascent to the federal reserve and the following year led the charge against antonio wei an executive at boutique asset management firm lazard when obama nominated him to serve a treasury’s undersecretary of domestic finance that veto power hung over hillary clinton’s presidential aspiration and warren exercised a quieter pressure on clinton to avoid similar choice the way warren ha nurtured her staff is not unrelated to her broader personnel project it’s one mean for preparing a slate of progressive minded expert to be worthy alternative warren ha been a private but constant voice to the biden administration on personnel decision “i think she’s an enormous resource for the administration ” damon silver the policy director for the afl cio and a friend of warren’s “she’s both a political power that ha to be answered at some level but she’s also a partner with great insight who offer a lot of help ” in biden’s transition warren found a likeminded ally in ted kaufman biden’s longtime chief of staff when he wa in the senate kaufman is best known for briefly taking over his old boss’s senate seat when biden ascended to the vice presidency in le known is the fact that he later replaced warren on the congressional panel overseeing the bank bailout and inherited her staff “elizabeth warren really know what she’s talking about and elizabeth warren can pick good staff people ” kaufman say of the lesson he took from the experience it wa the “unconventional reason ” he tell me why people who had worked for her were given a “head start” in their consideration for administration post his approach to key economic post across the administration echo warren’s priority “something i personally brought up at every personnel meeting we had do something about the revolving door and pick people who are sensitive to inequality and wealth ” warren demur when i ask how much she talk to her former staffer about their new post “i don’t want to say anything about that ” she tell me “i let them do their job ” indeed they work for the president now and it’s too soon to say whether these progressive personnel addition are having any influence they are after all just a fraction of the post across the administration most of them in crucial albeit lower level post though heartened to see several warren alumnus serving biden the senator’s ally are closely watching to see who the white house name to some still open positions—the antitrust job in the department of justice for example and who head the office of information and regulatory affair an obscure but influential post that oversees the white house’s implementation of executive action progressive are pushing biden to choose another warrenite for the role sitaraman the former warren aide who’s now a professor of constitutional law at vanderbilt university warren meanwhile continues to be warren cutting the new administration little slack she ha already sent letter to a number of biden’s agency demanding investigation into one thing or another including one to the sec requesting detail on how the agency will “crack down on year of distortion in security markets” that benefit the “wealthy few” in light of the recent volatility in the stock of gamestop and other company a the white house turn it attention to a job and infrastructure plan she reintroduced her wealth tax her trademark campaign proposal that would tax percent of individuals’ net worth above million to pay for it she’s already gearing up for a fight with the president who conspicuously rejected a wealth tax during his campaign last week warren hosted a roundtable with vocal progressive activists—including those from the sunrise movement working family party and others—and liberal wonk to kick off a pressure campaign for her proposal still it’s a marked change from where warren sat at the start of the last democratic presidency over dinner at the bombay club in april larry summer told warren then in charge of the oversight panel that she had a choice to make “i could be an insider or i could be an outsider ” warren recall in her memoir “outsiders can say whatever they want but people on the inside don’t listen to them insider however get lot of access and a chance to push their idea ” insider also followed one “unbreakable” rule “they don’t criticize other insider ” warren is now decidedly an insider a status she achieved by breaking that directive when necessary a for summer he wrote an op ed in the washington post last month undermining the white house’s trillion stimulus package warning it could “set off inflationary pressure of a kind we have not seen in a generation ” summer’s attack drew a swift and sharp rebuke from all corner of the white house among the dissenter ramamurti “the president and the administration have a lot of respect for professor summer ” he told cbs radio “but we disagree here ”',\n",

       " ('if joe biden defeat donald trump in the election — a current data suggests is likely to happen if existing political trend hold for the next five month — will he lead america through the pandemic and severe economic downturn by emulating the most influential progressive democratic president in american history franklin d roosevelt when the great recession hit in many believed democratic candidate barack obama would not only win the election but become a latter day fdr roosevelt spent the s passing a series of economic reform known a the new deal that alleviated the misery of the great depression and laid the foundation for the modern welfare state he focused on reforming the financial system to prevent another depression and succeeded until conservative deregulation stripped away those protection providing relief for the unemployed and poor and stimulating an economic recovery his signature policy included implementing program that created million of government job installing protection for labor union right establishing social security passing the first federal minimum wage and creating the united state housing authority advertisement given that the great recession wa the worst economic downturn since the great depression it seemed logical for democrat to hope that obama would be guided by roosevelt s spirit while obama wa a popular president with two major policy achievement in the american recovery and reinvestment act and affordable care act he fell short of roosevelt s standard in term of sheer scope recent report indicate that biden want to be more like roosevelt indeed during a meeting with his adviser in late april biden reportedly mentioned roosevelt by name and explicitly stated that he wanted his policy agenda to be a bold a that of the new dealer the former vice president ha already come out in favor of passing stimulus legislation a hell of a lot bigger than the trillion congress ha already spent strengthening regulation on bank and other powerful industry investing in a pandemic testing board on the scale of roosevelt s famous war production board creating a plus worker public health job corp providing free public college to lower income and middle class individual forgiving federal student loan debt at a minimum of per person requiring business to provide paid emergency sick leave increasing social security check by up to a month and likewise increasing the size of the relief check sent to family these policy proposal biden s campaign staffer have explained are only the beginning over the summer the former vice president plan on introducing more progressive plan salon reached out to the biden campaign for comment and did not hear back advertisement certainly biden s vision is an attempt to create contrast between him and a second trump term yet even if biden enacts the agenda that progressive dream of there is ample economic evidence that it may not be enough after all the underlying problem with america during the great depression the great recession and the pandemic crisis remains the same — free market capitalism in our current economic system constant consumption must continue unabated in order for prosperity to be maintained if that consumption is disrupted however briefly the economy itself grind to a halt with unemployment and poverty consequently skyrocketing even during period of supposed prosperity however free market capitalism naturally creates massive wealth inequality which force hardship onto the mass while only allowing a small minority to lead financially healthy life because free market capitalism reward those who already have power and put those who lack it at a further disadvantage terrible social evil like racism sexism and other form of oppression are reinforced and exacerbated finally — and most urgently — free market capitalism incentivizes the consumption of natural resource beyond ecologically sustainable level causing existential crisis for humanity like global warming the proliferation of weapon of mass destruction epidemic and lowered sperm count given the magnitude of the problem we face today — some of which existed during roosevelt s era and went unaddressed the new deal for example perpetuated racist inequality and others which are new to our own time roosevelt to be fair had no inkling that global warming even existed — the roosevelt biden approach is woefully inadequate the underlying principle behind the new dealer approach after all is to co opt left wing rhetoric and use it to pas policy that leave capitalist class structure in place while making it injustice just bearable enough for ordinary people that they don t violently rebel against it advertisement a economist attest that approach won t cut it in the s it really ha to be an all hand on deck that allows our economy to be completely transformed in order to literally allow human survival professor julia k steinberger a professor of ecological economics at the university of leeds told salon that s what s at stake in term of the gravity of the situation and the rapidity with which the climate crisis is unfolding steinberger say biden doesn t fully understand the magnitude of the crisis but to his credit he s at least surrounding himself with some people who understand that so the fact that he ha varshini prakash co founder of the sunrise movement on his climate advisory group is really important she added advertisement she added that biden instead of merely trying to revive the roosevelt esque new deal could be calling for a full green new deal that focus entirely on renewable and low carbon energy— which doe not include natural gas which doe not include any fossil fuel going forward — and make a clear signal that all fossil fuel will be ramped down to nothing within the scope of the next year steinberger pointed out that he could push for america to implement target to get the united state to net zero carbon emission by the middle of the century this steinberger argued could be closely tied into job creation effort the amount of money that need to be invested could easily be doubled in term of what need to happen that doesn t have to be a bad thing steinberger noted it can be part of the recovery with a lot of job creation and a lot of better living and working condition for a lot of people who suffer from air pollution from fossil fuel industry and from fossil fuel use for instance and which talk about the risk of coronavirus in the u a well advertisement steinberger also emphasized that any meaningful economic reform requires a major wealth tax so that the world is no longer burdened by the presence of a class of super rich individual steinberger contributed to a recent paper which demonstrated that wealthy individual are quite literally destroying the planet through over consumption wealthy people have an overall detrimental role that exists at many level steinberger explained because of over consumption because of what they consume — which tends to be high carbon transportation and other activity like that — and also because they have an influence in politics and in industry and also because they position the way they live is aspirational which mean that then other people want to have drive big car and fly private plane and so on i think that a wealth tax is absolutely necessary because one of the thing we have to stop is the ability of wealth to be so destructive salon also spoke with dr richard d wolff professor emeritus of economics at the university of massachusetts amherst wolff expressed skepticism that biden would actually prove to be a roosevelt style progressive — at least not unless left wing movement in the united state organize in way that can counteract the presence of highly organized right wing organization of which there are more in than there were in the s and simultaneously exert pressure on biden to deliver the good advertisement i would have to see more real pressure on him and this ha to do with how i understand what happened to roosevelt wolff told salon roosevelt wa a centrist also when he ran for president the first time in he wa a great believer in the balanced budget which is the old version of worrying about deficit which is a you know is a republican staple and a sure sign that the democrat is afraid of making any move other than might be consistent with that sort of crap wolff who pointed out that his father worked with first lady eleanor roosevelt whom wolff describes a an actual leftist with real credential explained that during the s there were a number of financially viable left wing organization with real political clout these included the congress of industrial organization two socialist organization and the communist party after fdr wa elected in they interacted with roosevelt and made it clear that if he didn t provide substantial relief for the working class and poor america could go the same way a russia did during the communist revolution which had occurred le than two decade earlier a a result roosevelt would not be president for very long roosevelt responded wolff recalled by saying that he would help the vulnerable if the left pressured him into doing it so that he could make it clear that he wa acting out of political necessity and simultaneously bring the left wing group into a larger political coalition backing him he could not do so however if they spoke of revolution which would be a deal breaker the end result wa the formation of a progressive political coalition that controlled the white house for of the next year and under future president would push through everything from the civil right legislation of the s to medicare and medicaid in the process they also protected capitalism from collapsing — although right winger particularly in the business community refused to see thing that way a good part of the business community hated him for it forever wolff told salon those were the forerunner of the koch brother today the john birch society of the right wing of the republican party they were horrified they wanted the response to the left to be repression police action military action all of that roosevelt would have no part of that advertisement wolff cited social security the first federal minimum wage and federal employment program a example of the kind of reform that were characteristic of roosevelt — not challenging capitalism or class structure but establishing a very basic safety net for the neediest american nothing comparable exists at this point to force biden to do anything like those thing wolff observed and he s not going to in my judgment because the potential leftist shift of politics in the united state ha two problem a it s not organized at least not yet and b it ha an organized far right wing opposition he added i think it s a matter of how quickly the left can get it act together and can above all organize itself i think if it doe that — and it obviously isn t going to do that between now and november — but if it can do that and let s say hypothetically biden listens you could re run roosevelt s story i think that s possible if there wa enough pressure i think biden would adjust even some of those in the camp of biden s primary rival bernie sander believe that biden could be whittled into a progressive incrementalist norman solomon co founder and national coordinator of rootsaction org and a sander delegate to the democratic national convention argues that biden is undoubtedly a superior candidate to trump even if biden doesn t seem too progressive on paper advertisement what i use is when you look into the eye of an undocumented immigrant would a biden administration make a difference yes solomon told salon if you look at somebody whose family will be shattered if daca isn t continued and put into reality yes it make a difference he also said that a biden presidency would also undoubtedly be better for people who rely on snap colloquially known a food stamp to survive or people whose life will change based on the decision made by the judge who will be appointed by the next administration at the same time solomon pointed out that biden is predominantly a corporate creature he s predominantly stocking the transition team in his campaign with corporate people at the same time that s a given and we can fight against it we can make some progress he made a similar point about biden s climate change proposal arguing that it doesn t have near the sense of magnitude of what s needed but he s not a wall it s almost an existential almost a religious question for some people is how much doe this all matter so we get another new deal how much doe that matter with an arm race and climate change you know the two biggest existential threat to the planet and humanity nuclear weapon and climate so we could say oh well the new deal won t matter i think the new deal that would matter a lot is the green new deal perhaps that really is the point to be made about this election if the question is whether trump or biden would be better for prosperity and civil right biden who seems to envision himself a another roosevelt would be far better than trump advertisement at the same time a mere return to a lesser evil is how we got to where we are in the first place earth will not survive if capitalism allows u to continue ravaging it resource a generation that thanks to the internet ha learned how to expose and understand oppression is not going to tolerate the perpetuation of economic injustice that force billion to live in poverty and which deny nearly everyone except the affluent of meaningful opportunity to maximize their potential to do good in this world and achieve happiness for themselves that same generation is seeing how capitalism is inextricably linked with white supremacy and patriarchy with intersecting layer of power that cause violence and repression against marginalized group at home and abroad they may not accept the policy of the biden who helped beef up the police state who ha a history of being handsy with woman and who earned the democratic nomination by convincing establishment democrat to unite behind him in order to stop a democratic socialist who wa about to sweep the primary sen bernie

energy decarbonized and more inclusive economy most american who fear climate chaos embrace clean energy opportunity and welcome american innovation and leadership should be celebrating — and are but hold your breath the good news run even deeper than this the striking emphasis that the new administration ha given to it whole government climate strategy the repeatedly noted climate depth of his

buttigieg and the department of the interior deb haaland along with the breadth of new climate initiative are only a part of the new administration s commitment to climate progress this shock and awe launch also reflects an external reality the trump administration s dogged march into the past had departed from any semblance of where america wa headed the first wave of climate progress under biden is almost all low hanging fruit no regret and we can all unite on this because trump s legacy wa starkly at war with economic and marketplace reality not just climate science look at the chorus that ha responded to biden s climate drumbeat politico hail a coalition that range from labor union anti fracking activist and racial justice advocate to leader of wall street the auto industry and the u s chamber of commerce a lining up with biden s broad thrust senate majority leader chuck schumer on msnbc boast that his program to phase out internal combustion car and truck by is a winner because he already ha the support not only of climate advocate but also of the united auto worker ford and general motor while the obstacle still cited a lying in biden s way are substantial they are almost entirely inside the beltway where the powerful influence of fossil fuel producing state like west virginia embodied in sen joe manchin and kentucky minority leader mitch mcconnell is repeatedly and appropriately recited but what are oil company who wield the big fossil fuel stick actually saying yes they claim biden is going too far but almost exclusively in one narrow part of his program the phase out of oil gas and coal extraction on federal land indeed the oil industry is actually joining biden s alliance in it emphasis on tougher drilling and pollution standard for extraction advocacy of carbon pricing in some form is also making it way into houston lobbying memo in a deeply polarized senate getting legislation of any significance through is indeed going to test the new president s capitol hill negotiating chop but climate is getting so much emphasis in biden s first two week in large part because it ha become a le not more divisive issue across american society it s a good place for the new administration to bring the country together perhaps because the community that are taking the biggest climate hit — from fire flooding storm and energy sector layoff — are overwhelmingly in region where trump not biden came out on top a hidden secret is that rural america which ha become the heart of red america is where storm drought fire and flood hit hardest miami beach can afford sea wall cedar rapid need uncle sam to repair it levee biden s broader coalition — you could also throw in blackrock whose ceo larry fink devoted his annual letter to the urgency of business embracing the climate challenge — emerged even before the november election major oil company had opposed trump s effort to block the cleanup of methane from oil and gas drilling ford and volkswagen had partnered with california to undercut the trump administration s rollback of auto emission limit most of the biggest power utility had pledged to cut from to of their current carbon pollution sixteen state had persuaded even the deadlocked congress to commit the u s to phasing out climate dangerous hfc refrigerant a part of the pandemic relief bill so climate progress is now a powerful american consensus precisely because we have realized that it is not a matter of sacrifice but of opportunity not austerity but prosperity not american decline but american recovery none of this mean we can relax big coalition like convoy can bog down at the speed of the slowest member and the biggest looming barrier is that the faster decarbonization race ahead the greater the risk to worker and community left behind while there are lot of good idea floating around for how to enable fossil dependent segment of our nation to ride the clean energy wave most of them remain somewhat uncertain and gauzy — after all only a year ago we were having trouble getting mcconnell to agree to sustain pension and health care for mineworker in his own state if we don t take more seriously our need to spread the benefit of the clean energy transition to every zip code and every demography we will blow our best change to make america truly great — for the st century',\n",

       " ('it wa very very chilly in my corner of pennsylvania the morning of last fall s election i live in northampton county a swing county in this very large swing state a county so reflective of america a a whole that it ha picked the president on all but three occasion since it wa one of county out of america s that voted for barack obama in and before flipping to donald trump in in it would once again pick the winner by backing joe biden — but i didn t know that at the time nor did trump and many of his supporter who would go on to act like sore loser on a historic scale — and betray our state s core value in the process at least one trump supporter seemed to be trying to intimidate the waiting voter at my precinct passing our polling place multiple time in a large truck covered in pro trump paraphernalia and blaring music a it turned out my precinct went to biden by a very narrow margin but more than two third of those who voted in person supported trump in a way that moment encapsulates pennsylvania politics people in this county part of an eastern region of the commonwealth known a the lehigh valley are generally kind and laid back folk regardless of their political view a with the rest of america however there is a poisonous undercurrent emanating from the right wing that is both tragic and dangerous sometimes it merely manifest itself in obnoxious boosterism such a the macho posturing displayed by the driver of that pro trump truck on other occasion it becomes literally dangerous to democracy a american saw earlier this month when a mob of trump supporter some of them pennsylvanian wa egged on by the president to swarm the capitol so they could overturn biden s victory unfortunately that toxicity ha trickled up transforming the pennsylvania republican party in the process a a recent politico article noted a state gop that only a few decade ago wa renowned for producing independent minded moderate like sen arlen specter and john heinz and govs william scranton and dick thornburgh ha now bent the knee to trumpism all but one of the house republican in pennsylvania s congressional delegation voted to invalidate the commonwealth s electoral vote which were won by biden they did this even though trump lost all of the voter fraud related case he brought to court many presided over by republican judge lost all but one of the overall legal case he pursued and wa told by his own attorney general william barr that the department of justice s investigation into the election had found biden s win to be legitimate they did this even though trump had incited a riot on the capitol — making him the first of america s incumbent president to lose a bid for another term and respond by attempting to stay in power through force — and despite the fact that trump ha undermined his own credibility for year by communicating a far back a that he only accepts an election s result if he is declared the winner they did this even though trump ha not provided a shred of evidence of widespread fraud much le on a scale necessary to give him a victory and even though trump wa caught on tape threatening georgia election official to find the vote he needed to win there the pennsylvania gop s cravenness did not begin with their electoral certification vote in the preceding week republican state legislative leader urged congress to object to biden s victory in the electoral college or somehow delay the certification of his vote one pennsylvania gop congressman scott perry ha even aroused controversy for working behind the scene to help trump overturn biden s victory in georgia i m shocked at scott rich grucela a former democratic state representative who served from to — and thus worked with perry after the latter joined that body in — told salon recalling that he remembers when perry first came into the general assembly the scott perry that i m listening to and seeing today is not the scott perry that i knew i don t understand what happened to scott but he s a totally different person from what i see on the news or what i ve read in article although perry wa always conservative grucela noted that he wasn t — i hate to use the term off the wall but he wasn t he trailed off sounding deeply disappointed i can t believe he would be one of these guy that is enamored with trump i mean he is a very intelligent guy grucela whose daughter wa one of my high school classmate recalled fondly how he used to have close friendship with republican a well a democrat citing a an example that one of the republican governor with whom he worked mark schweiker wa one of the nicest governor i served under he told salon that for roughly the first eight year that he served the ethos in the state s republican party wa very collegial creating an environment in which people could work with each other and keep partisan difference at the office several republican friend of mine i might debate on the house and then afterwards in the evening have dinner with them and talk about our family grucela told salon he noticed a change in pennsylvania republican behavior when the tea party rose up during obama s presidency and began scaring more moderate republican with the threat of primary challenge leading to increasingly intransigent ideological behavior and a reduced willingness to work with democrat grucela drew a direct line between that development and the eventual rise of trumpism another local pennsylvania politician northampton county democratic committee chair matthew munsey told salon that he noticed people are starting to lose a sense of shared reality since the rise of trump i briefly served a a committee person under munsey from two year before trump s election until i wa hired a a staff writer at salon in general we ve really lost a sense of a common belief system munsey explained when contrasting what he ha witnessed prior to and after trump s rise to power it s almost like people are living in an alternate reality specifically with trump supporter he said that this phenomenon ha not only driven republican farther to the right but also caused some to leave the party we ve seen some republican or former republican who have said i m voting for the democrat or i m switching my party and i m voting for democrat from now on munsey told salon it seems like they have not bought into that alternate reality and that s probably the big overall shift and difference in thing it s almost impossible to have coherent discussion with people who don t even agree with the same basis of reality i encountered this problem when i spoke with dean browning a former republican congressional candidate and former commissioner in lehigh county which is adjacent to northampton county whose twitter account ha in the past been the focus of controversy more than once during our conversation browning admitted that there wa no evidence that biden had won pennsylvania through fraud but insisted that it wa still valid for trump supporter to question the election s legitimacy because biden supporter could not prove that ballot harvesting had not occurred an argument that i repeatedly pointed out is a logical fallacy they re questioning the legitimacy of this election because of mail in ballot browning told salon repeating the debunked claim that mail in balloting is unusually susceptible to fraud trump himself praised mail in balloting in and cast an absentee ballot in i will absolutely concede that you re correct that there ha there ha been no widespread proof of fraud and the reason there is not or the difficulty with that i will freely admit it is all but impossible to prove fraud with a mail in voting system he ultimately acknowledged that biden is the president of the united state i fully accept that he wa sworn in and that he is the president of the united state he s my president he is the president for every american citizen the tragic irony is that if the pennsylvania trumpists were willing to look at the state s history they would see that it helped create modern democracy itself when william penn founded the colony of pennsylvania in he designed it government to be one of the modern world s first authentic democracy particularly emphasizing the importance of religious freedom he used his quaker belief to create a peaceful colony that stressed individual dignity forty year later a bostonian named benjamin franklin fled to pennsylvania and declared the colony to be his home after falling in love with it intellectually socially and culturally liberating atmosphere franklin would later go on to become one of america s most important founding father a well a a prolific writer inventor activist scientist and advocate of enlightenment ideal thanks to the legacy of people like penn and franklin historian henry adam would later write that had new england new york and virginia been swept out of existence in democracy could have better spared them all than have lost pennsylvania subsequent century would prove him correct a both the democratic and republican party produced pennsylvanian who distinguished themselves by being on the right side of history among the republican you had rep thaddeus stevens one of the most eloquent and passionate abolitionist to serve both prior to and after the civil war and gov gifford pinchot an influential early th century conservationist and close friend to one of america s most iconic president theodore roosevelt on the democratic side you had rep david wilmot who famously proposed banning slavery from the western land america conquered during the mexican american war and ultimately became a republican and a senator a a result of his opposition to slavery more than a century later one democratic governor milton shapp implemented the nation s most comprehensive sunshine law up to that time in response to the watergate scandal and later became the first practicing jew to run for president in a major party roughly a decade later another democratic governor bob casey created the child s health insurance program chip which covered uninsured child throughout the state and would later be used a a model for a federal program that isn t to say there isn t also a le savory side to pennsylvania s history the noble spirit embodied by the like of penn franklin stevens pinchot wilmot shapp and casey stand in stark contrast to that of james buchanan who until biden s victory last year wa the only pennsylvanian ever elected to the presidency like trump buchanan s presidency wa dogged by scandal he narrowly avoided impeachment and notoriously put itself on the wrong side of history when it came to matter of racial justice with buchanan adamantly supporting slavery trump let u not forget wa elected in no small part due to racist dog whistling against african american and mexican immigrant and a the president refused to denounce white supremacist pushed for bigoted immigration policy and opposed the black life matter movement just a notably buchanan reacted to his disappointment with an election outcome in a manner not dissimilar from trump although buchanan wa not on the ballot a his first and only term came to a close in he had made it clear to voter that he did not want to be replaced by the republican nominee abraham lincoln because of lincoln s opposition to expanding slavery when lincoln won anyway buchanan refused to work with the incoming lincoln administration and even tacitly encouraged the south to start the civil war saying in his state of the union message that the injured state after having first used all peaceful and constitutional mean to obtain redress would be justified in revolutionary resistance to the government of the union although buchanan never threatened to forcibly keep lincoln from taking office which is what trump did to biden his willingness to support a civil war because he didn t like it that lincoln won is analogous to trump trying to overturn the result of the election because he didn t like it that he lost so how doe one address these issue how doe one reach out to a party that ha become le about ideology than about a cult like worship of a single politician first it is important to remember that the people supporting trump — while they are extremely wrong for doing so — are not monster they are human being i wa reminded of this not only from my experience on election day but from the word of pennsylvania state sen john yudichak who wa initially elected a a democrat but switched to being an independent in and began caucusing with republican despite his decision to leave the democratic party however yudichak endorsed biden in the election — and told salon that his gop colleague response to this wa ha been a professional and a generous a i could have ever hoped for in a similar vein munsey also observed that in his experience trying to reach trump supporter he ha found it s often more effective to find common ground on an emotional level than to overwhelm them with fact we need to recognize that fact very rarely persuade people because if they were open to hearing the fact they already would have heard them munsey explained so me telling the fact that are already out there in what i would describe a unbiased source is not going to change anybody s mind we have to connect on a personal level we have to talk about our shared value because a human we have shared value we care about our family we want to make sure that our family and the people that we love are taken care of he added that it is also helpful to respectfully ask question that allow other people to examine whether the thing they say they value match with what they are supporting politically and whether the thing they re supporting politically are actually supporting the thing that they value munsey pointed out that the key here is to not try to directly persuade people but by asking the question and letting them realize in the answer these may not seem like the most promising option but they are the best one we have — and they are in keeping with the spirit of pennsylvania',\n",

that the capacity to sustain and prosecute an argument through the press wasn’t there in part because of former president donald trump “we were spending the early part of the year dealing with the insurrection and impeachment trial and then we jumped right into passage ” the aide said “so the attention of the d c medium wasn’t on this legislation it wa on the fallout of jan ” in the absence of a cohesive strategy from congressional gop leader or the party apparatus individual republican like gingrich and gop aligned outside group were left to mount their own attack against biden’s american rescue plan some criticism focused on pet project within the legislation others accused democrat of using the shadow of a pandemic to expand the welfare state “this bill wa so extreme and so little about it wa actually covid relief ” said tim phillips president of american for prosperity which ha accused democrat of “leveraging” the latest legislative response to the covid crisis “to advance partisan priority at the expense of everyday american ” but other criticism of the bill caused headache sen lindsey graham r s c likened the bill’s billion fund for black farmer to “reparations ” and after sen tom cotton r ark slammed democrat for opposing an amendment that would have excluded prisoner from receiving relief check critic were quick to point out that he voted for the second relief package last december despite knowing it contained no provision to stop inmate from receiving such payment none of the attack line seemed to resonate with voter who began receiving stimulus check a early a last weekend and appear overwhelmingly supportive of the law a cbs yougov survey released on sunday showed percent of adult believe the american rescue plan will benefit the middle class more than wealthy american the bill’s passage coincides with an uptick in vaccination and recognition from democrat and allied teacher union that school need to reopen soon — which together have the potential for improving the electoral landscape for democrat a they try to keep both chamber of the congress that’s left the gop with little left to do but bank on the possibility that voter will over time simply forget the way in which the law impacted them “i think once the sugar high of the stimulus check wear off — a much a they are needed and are important — the bill is going to sink itself over time if it’s remembered at all ” said another senate gop aide “it’s at the peak of it popularity right now and the more it becomes unpopular we’ll pound against them ” added another inside the white house the absence of a sustained gop pushback to the bill did not come a a particular shock aide had long felt that biden had the upper hand and that trump had tied his own party in political knot the former president had pushed for congress to pas direct check in december and blasted republican leader like then senate majority leader mitch mcconnell when they declined to include them in a relief package he had also added trillion of dollar to the deficit through a mix of tax break to the wealthy and covid related legislation with little pushback from his party what credible argument could republican attempt to put forward that would resonate with american and enough democrat to block the package biden aide wondered john anzalone who worked a chief pollster to the biden campaign and remains a close outside adviser said the republican response wa both late and head scratching the gop didn’t push back on the bill a a deficit buster instead they framed it a unrelated to covid which biden’s team felt only alienated voter who directly tied the virus to their economic plight and saw element of the bill — like childcare tax credit and lowering healthcare cost — a critical to getting past the pandemic “this is just really mind boggling ” anzalone said “at a time that we’re going through three or four crisis at once they have basically just punted they ve completely punted ” while the white house may have been pleased with the lack of a sustained pushback from republican there were still question about how to handle it for many biden’s pledge to be a unifying president meant that they had to at least show they were trying to win over gop vote and early on there wa some genuine belief that they could get a handful sen bob casey d pa a biden ally said he wa encouraged when the president sat down with republican in the oval office in late february his optimism faded however when the gop official led by maine sen susan collins floated a billion alternative he believed that the white house would inevitably have to use reconciliation a budget mechanism that allows for expedited passage of a bill with simple majority approval “but i thought what would happen once we were on that pathway is that in the end for the final vote that you would get maybe two three or four republican ” casey added “i wa not shocked but i wa a little surprised that it wa unanimous against it ” republican used the flimsiness of biden’s outreach to decry that he had reneged on his pledge to seek a middle ground but inside the gop there were concern that process argument weren’t moving the needle a third senate gop aide argued that the attack line surrounding the absence of bipartisan outreach went over the head of most american “we got beat on this one ” the aide said in a blunt assessment of their party’s response a republican complained about the partisan nature of the law’s construction the white house settled on a new talking point while the bill may not have the support of the gop in washington they contended it wa still “bipartisan” because it wa backed by a growing list of republican governor and state and local official who urged it passage on that front they benefited from the poll which showed healthy gop support for the measure and by local republican who in many case embraced the cash that would end up flowing to their city and state casey said he wa on a call friday with a bipartisan group of county commissioner “i didn t hear any of them say ‘hey we don t need the money ’” casey said “i didn t hear any of the national republican argument ” asked about republican critique that the local government money wa effectively a bailout of liberal city like san francisco jeff williams the mayor of arlington texas said the bill relies on an established and agreed upon formula the federal government ha used for decade williams a registered republican also likened the pandemic to a natural disaster but instead of leveling home and hollowing out business physically it took a toll on the locality in an economic sense “we didn t say it wa a bailout for houston when they suffered the flood here ” williams continued “same thing for new orleans when they were flooded in hurricane katrina we didn t say we were bailing new orleans out basically what we re doing is taking care of a natural disaster and helping our city county and state get back ” with the relief bill nearing passage during the last few week republican recentered their messaging once again this time to the southern border where a wave of migrant and unaccompanied child have overwhelmed facility and created a new political vulnerability for biden but those attack aren’t meant to damage the relief bill so much a move it out of the political spotlight “they weren t a month ago thinking ‘oh well we re going to be rescued by the border ’” when republican voted against the package anzalone said “it doesn t absolve them in any way from basically being partisan and politician in a time of economic emergency ”',\n",

package across the finish line is up for debate “it’s doable but the democrat are not going to be able to reinvent the wheel” by including a lot of provision not palpable to republican jeff davis a

transportation dot secretary nominee pete buttigieg a his “chief salesman apostle” to help sell the proposal to congress and at public event davis said “it’s the first time we’ve had someone a dot secretary coming in with a significant national political following ” however biden’s political edge could be undercut davis explained by the senate cloture rule which requires vote to cut off debate on most type of legislation – meaning that senator in the opposition party can filibuster the majority’s agenda davis also pointed out that while some republican may want to get a long term infrastructure bill passed “they’re not eager to raise tax to pay for anything ” he said “and now that all this money ha gone out on covid and the trump tax cut there’s not going to be a big appetite for deficit spending ” a view from inside john delaney a former u s congressman who released his own trillion infrastructure proposal in may when he wa a contender for the democratic presidential nomination said there are other structural issue in congress that need to be addressed “one of the first thing i worked on when i came to washington wa a big bipartisan infrastructure proposal ” delaney said thursday delaney a senior adviser at startup investment firm revolution wa speaking with revolution founder steve case on startup and the biden administration “republicans were advocating at the time for fixing our international tax system which wa trapping money overseas and being prevented from flowing back to the united state and preventing u from getting tax revenue from it i proposed fixing that system to make it more pro business and use the revenue from that to invest in infrastructure – it got huge bipartisan support but the issue wa to some extent bipartisan legislation is at a disadvantage in the congress because the leadership want to put up partisan win ” business push one of the most powerful lobbying group in washington – the u s chamber of commerce – ha made infrastructure it top legislative priority the group which recently launched the “build by the fourth of july” campaign to push congress to get infrastructure legislation done by that date is optimistic even with a senate and a house chamber that’s separated by only five vote “we can also stimulate the economy in a major way if we finally do the long overdue and broadly supported work of rebuilding our infrastructure ” said u s chamber ceo tom donohue at his state of american business address on jan “it’s the number one way to raise productivity create job and drive up income in a

citizen are counted in the census pulling back on the harsh deportation priority of the past four year and cutting off fund to donald trump s most vaunted border wall with mexico for many among u who feared that biden would hesitate to use his presidential power to undo trump s damage these action offer immediate vindication of the idea that there is indeed a difference to the life of marginalized human being between having a democrat versus a republican in the white house anticipating biden s executive action on immigration the trump administration created some potentially difficult hurdle to biden s agenda via a series of so called sanctuary for american first enactment safe agreement between a handful of state and the department of homeland security which signed them during trump s final day in office these agreement require cooperation between the department of homeland security and law enforcement agency and require a day notice of intent to terminate it wa trump s parting shot to a nation that us and abuse immigrant labor revenue culture and other benefit but president biden ha not restricted himself to executive action on immigration he ha sent an outline of a comprehensive immigration bill to congress for consideration that ha a it centerpiece a pathway to citizenship for nearly million undocumented resident of the nation it is a bold move but precisely the correct one in a nation reeling from four toxic year of donald trump given that trump rode into office on the wind of anti immigrant hate that he vigorously fanned during his campaign it is fitting that biden begin his term by undoing the damage by whatever mean he can—legislative and executive action with a view to the long term problem of immigration biden s proposed bill includes a mechanism for immigrant registered under the deferred action for childhood arrival daca program to immediately apply for legal residency if they meet certain work or educational criterion those enrolled in the temporary protected status tps program a well a farmworkers will also be eligible for the same others in the nation without paper a of january would have a five year pathway to legal residency if they pay their tax and pas a background check and then have the option of pursuing citizenship three year later it will not be an easy task to pas such a bill for decade congressional failure to tackle immigration reform ha stemmed from a toxic recipe that includes one part republican intransigence and one part democratic spinelessness those two force have worked in tandem to ensure the nation march ever rightward democrat will need to adopt the combative and aggressive posture that republican do when they cut safety net program or hand more money to billionaire a if on cue republican denounced the bill before they had even read it sen marco rubio of florida called it blanket amnesty while sen tom cotton of arkansas denounced it a total amnesty iowa senator and top ranking republican chuck grassley echoed the same calling it mass amnesty and a nonstarter even trump s former white house adviser stephen miller the architect of the cruelest anti immigrant policy of the past four year and who by all right ought to disappear from public view in shame had the audacity to speak out against the bill when republican critic of the biden immigration plan use the word amnesty to refer to an arduous pathway to citizenship they are already playing hardball by characterizing the plan in these term they are once more playing into nativist sentiment in the american public to stoke mass resentment and imply that those breaking u s law will simply be forgiven without consequence it is the same dangerous impulse that gave rise to trump if anything the word amnesty when used in relation to immigrant ought to be associated most directly with the gop demigod ronald reagan whose signature on a sweeping immigration bill helped nearly million undocumented immigrant in order to reconcile the cognitive dissonance on reagan s mythical status and their racist anti immigrant hate conservative turned to their favorite pastime claiming the opposite is true in a op ed cotton claimed that reagan considered the bill to be the biggest mistake of his presidency more recently former arizona state senator and u s senate candidate kelli ward echoed the same saying it wa reagan s biggest regret it wa not a researcher with the competitive enterprise institute a conservative organization wrote on the far right website the daily caller that the claim of reagan s regret is built on hearsay and concluded that reagan would understand that his law failed to stop illegal immigration not because we allowed people to stay but because we refused to allow more to come he added in his farewell address he said he wanted an america open to anyone with the will and heart to get here that doesn t sound like regret to me indeed various time over many year republican have openly backed immigration reform that offered pathway to citizenship the reason we have donald trump a a nominee today is because we a republican have failed on this issue said former republican congressman raúl labrador a tea party conservative who wa one of the gang of eight a bipartisan group of lawmaker who came tantalizingly close to pushing through comprehensive immigration reform during president barack obama s second term even fox news virulently nativist host sean hannity said nearly a decade ago if people are here law abiding participating for year their kid are born here you know first

energy that he said would create million of new job now the question is will he follow through the last democratic president barack obama had a mixed environmental record he signed the paris climate accord and gave a modest boost to clean energy production his administration get credit for issuing higher standard for automobile fuel emission and to reduce electricity in appliance from dishwasher to walk in freezer but under obama the environmental protection agency dragged it foot against imposing co standard for power plant and oil refinery and wasted precious time pushing an ineffective cap and trade system rather than a badly needed carbon tax certainly obama wa mile better than trump but if we have any hope of really tackling this global challenge biden will have to be mile better than obama obama will not be enough the good news is that the candidate joe biden had the most ambitious plan addressing the climate crisis ever proposed by a major party nominee for president his infrastructure and clean energy proposal included a pledge to achieve percent clean electricity by to a number of observer setting a the target appears unrealistic but it s what the science tell u we must do and a recent analysis by professor sonia aggarwal from the university of california berkeley school of public policy show that percent carbon free electricity is achievable by due to plummeting solar wind and battery cost candidate biden also ha been seemingly undeterred by the trillion price tag over four year because he proposes the climate crisis a an opportunity to create million of job address systemic inequity and correct environmental problem in community most heavily affected by climate impact but it s easy to make campaign promise now candidate biden ha to pivot to become president biden how feasible is it to achieve these goal and what doe it mean for those living in frontline community it s an uphill climb to be sure to achieve his ambitious pillar for a clean energy revolution mean doubling the best rate of solar and wind deployment each year from to —then tripling it each year from to this will need to go hand in hand with building a new energy grid which is a key part of the plan to create half a million job annually which cannot be shipped overseas he will also need to eliminate emission from the energy producing sector which would result in substantial health and environmental benefit a second pillar of his campaign s climate plan relies on reducing greenhouse emission by setting higher efficiency standard for car building and appliance this focus on efficiency is key since the more energy we save the le we need to produce with the new renewable source increased efficiency involves energy audit building upgrade and weatherization and his climate plan call for retrofitting four million building it also proposes constructing million energy efficient new home to help address the affordable housing crisis all of which would create many job a third pillar biden s plan for increasing automobile efficiency involves rebate to trade in gas guzzling vehicle for more efficient u made car his plan also call for transitioning to electric vehicle by installing a half a million ev charging station he proposed an environmental justice initiative that directs percent of his investment in clean energy directly toward fenceline community populated mainly by minority and indigenous community that are disproportionately harmed by the impact of climate change his plan includes a pledge to plug abandoned oil and gas well and reclaim abandoned mine that pollute the air or water near tribal community when environmental and health cost are added to the balance sheet a clean energy grid turn out to be a lower cost option compared to burning fossil fuel so it could potentially save money certainly the biden administration will rejoin the paris climate pact to resume leadership in securing other nation commitment even though biden s plan may not be a ambitious or a comprehensive a the green new deal it is more practical and very much in line with climate scientist priority if enacted fully it would result in transformational change but while his plan ha the right to do item and he will have a mostly cooperative house majority how can he make progress given the senate will likely remain in gop hand for starter biden can sign a series of executive order to achieve a number of important objective including percent clean energy he could declare a climate emergency stop all new fossil fuel mining and drilling lease and strengthen automobile efficiency and power plant emission standard initiated during obama s tenure some democrat from gas and coal state like montana s jon tester and pennsylvania s bob casey who resisted obama s climate policy effort have softened their stance recently a the impact of climate change have become more obvious but others such a democratic senator joe manchin from the big coal state of west virginia and currently ranking member of the senate energy committee might stall progress a a former longtime senator joe biden ha a deep understanding of the arcane way of

sincere i certainly hope that this is true and if so that trump continues making sure biden is ready to lead america when he take over on jan trump is nothing if not mercurial and if he reverts back to his earlier practice of not cooperating with biden on the pandemic historian will likely rank him along with james buchanan a one of the worst president of all time more to the point trump and buchanan have one big historical similarity both men refused to accept the result of election that did not favor them instead punishing the american people during a period of great crisis by refusing to work with their successor advertisement most forebodingly in buchanan s case his pigheadedness during his lame duck period heralded the outbreak of the civil war and trump s parallel with buchanan — who is regularly ranked a one of the worst president of all time — are particularly striking let s compare the two situation starting with trump a of today trump continues to deny that biden legitimately defeated him in the election and make numerous claim of voter fraud all of which are without merit a part of this unwillingness to accept the voter verdict trump s administration ha up to now refused to work with biden s team when it come to addressing the ongoing coronavirus pandemic at the time of this writing that pandemic ha infected nearly million people in the united state with the novel coronavirus and led to roughly fatality from the disease it cause covid a recent study project that the number of people who develop covid could nearly double between now and biden s inauguration even if trump hadn t shirked his responsibility to work with biden s people in responding to the pandemic his post election behavior would be unprecedented indeed he is alone among sitting president who were denied an additional term by voter in refusing to accept the election result advertisement how doe this compare to buchanan buchanan though not up for reelection himself in wa deeply unhappy with the fact that republican candidate abraham lincoln prevailed in that contest over his own vice president southern democratic nominee john breckinridge or one of the other major candidate unlike lincoln who had been elected on a platform of restricting the expansion of slavery in the united state buchanan wa pro slavery despite hailing from the antislavery state of pennsylvania during his presidency buchanan inappropriately encouraged the supreme court to rule in the notorious dred scott decision that african american held no right of any kind which it did packed his cabinet full of unapologetic racist who argued slavery wa good for america and repeatedly sided with the south when it advocated for imperialist war which would help slavery and tried to expand their evil institution throughout the country when the south rejected lincoln s election by threatening to secede buchanan refused to work with the incoming administration to assuage their fear indeed quite to the contrary buchanan took the position that the federal government should not intervene if a state decides to secede from the union while lincoln believed that secession wa illegal and slavery wa immoral buchanan declared in his december state of the union message that attempt to stop slavery were actually wrong and argued that if the north refused to allow slave state to have their way the injured state after having first used all peaceful and constitutional mean to obtain redress would be justified in revolutionary resistance to the government of the union from that point on buchanan did a little a he could get away with while state after state seceded to form the confederacy ultimately leaving lincoln with no option but to wage the civil war by the time he took office advertisement until trump refused to work with biden on the coronavirus pandemic buchanan wa the only president to ever behave this badly in his administration s final lame duck month sure there had been outgoing president who responded petulantly after stinging electoral repudiation both john adam and john quincy adam refused to attend their successor inauguration out of spite while herbert hoover wasted time clashing with franklin roosevelt about how to address the great depression but only buchanan match trump when it came to a combined refusal to work with an incoming administration in order to save life and a bitterness over an election result that directly or indirectly rejected them these aren t the only parallel between buchanan and trump both administration were packed with official who had conflict of interest and were thus riddled with corruption although buchanan himself wa able to narrowly avoid being impeached each one wa overtly racist obviously and both abused their executive power to violate the right of racial justice advocate whether it wa trump sending secret police to kidnap protester in portland or buchanan tacitly supporting violence against abolitionist in kansa and trying to extort lawmaker into taking pro slavery position each inherited a good economy and then failed to bring about recovery when there wa an economic crash and most notably each wa at best allegedly guilty of treason with many buchanan official actively supporting the confederacy after he left office the only president to indisputably commit treason is john tyler who a a former president sided with the confederacy and wa elected to the confederate house of representative advertisement this isn t to say that the analogy between buchanan and trump is perfect while both men were incompetent president buchanan actually had extensive prior government experience a a congressman senator diplomat and secretary of state in addition buchanan never threatened to stay in power past his term although this wa easier for him since he wa not on the ballot in by contrast whatever else may be said of trump he at least theoretically ha an opportunity to redeem himself between now and the end of his term his team s decision to work with biden on addressing the pandemic could be an early sign of precisely that indeed by working with biden on the pandemic and other important transition related matter ending his public display of bitterness over the election result and walking back his previous violent rhetoric to guarantee a peaceful transition of power trump could avoid a buchanan esque reputation there s even an uncanny parallel in that each one term president misstep wrought hundred of thousand of death american have died of covid so far american died during the civil war advertisement if there is any silver lining here it is that trump s action up to this point have not been entirely unprecedented the republic survived buchanan and it can survive trump too',\n",

senate is split evenly between the two party with vice president kamala harris tipping the chamber to democrat with her tie breaking vote even so passing major legislation requires vote to overcome

the strongest possible bill without concession to republicans’ demand like boosting border security spending he said hope for a bipartisan breakthrough are “a fool’s errand” because the gop ha largely opposed immigration overhaul for so long but prevailing without gop vote would mean virtual unanimity among congressional democrat a huge challenge it would also mean democrat would have to eliminate the senate filibuster which they may not have the vote to do or concoct other procedural route around the vote hurdle “i’m going to start negotiating” with republican said durbin he said a bipartisan bill would be better “if we can do it” because it would improve chance for passage democrat already face attack from republican eyeing next year’s election on an issue that helped power trump’s victory by fortifying his support from many white voter house minority leader kevin mccarthy r calif said biden’s proposal would “prioritize help for illegal immigrant and not our fellow citizen ” sen rick scott r fla who head the senate republican campaign committee said the measure would hurt “hard working american and the million of immigrant working their way through the legal immigration process ” democrat say such allegation are false but say it’s difficult to compose crisp sound bite response on the complex issue it requires having “an adult conversation” with voter rep abigail

dollar infrastructure plan through congress transform the policy that underpin america s arterials of commerce and blunt the worst effect of climate change those lofty goal require turning buzzword and pledge into real change that tackle systemic ingrained way of doing business at the tip of the spear buttigieg who catapulted himself two year ago from a little known mayor of indiana’s fourth largest city to a top tier presidential candidate who ultimately endorsed biden at a critical moment he wa rewarded with the role of running a department with an billion budget — nearly time the budget of south bend ind which he ran for eight year — and starring role a an economic pitchman for biden’s next big act barely a month into the job buttigieg ha touched on improving racial equity in transportation at virtually every television interview embarked on a listening tour with all manner of minority group and list it a one of his highest priority in the job in two interview with politico since taking over buttigieg who noted that that he took office during black history month explained how he’s hoping to take an expansive and broad look at how to improve equity it’s the right moment to be looking at the equity implication of everything we do in the federal government he said it s an effort that could start with even the most basic administrative task like hiring it s worth noting that just in term of the workforce of the department and career in transportation we ve got a lot of work to do to build a more diverse and representative department and workforce buttigieg said confronting the past addressing the inequity built into the national transportation system would require dismantling or retooling decade worth of physical infrastructure and addressing a more subtle but equally powerful culture that come from le visible part of dot’s work like in setting standard for how road are designed “the big picture challenge is that we’re trying to dig ourselves out of a hole that’s been dug over decade in term of decision making and asset that are out there and have torn up community that are no longer there or have been bifurcated ” said anthony foxx who served a transportation secretary under president obama in an interview this is part of what biden s ambitious build back better plan call for including an express desire to redo street and main artery in community demolish blighted property repair and lay down new sidewalk and redo streetscapes and lighting among other thing crumbling infrastructure is a barrier to growth and prosperity if road are falling apart if light and landscaping of public area are not tended to if sidewalk are dilapidated or school are outdated if there are no park for kid to play in after school if there is no fresh food for mile if there are abandoned house that need to be demolished or empty strip mall and not enough infrastructure to prevent fire if there is nowhere to go when you are in a mental health crisis — how can a community thrive the plan asks foxx perhaps more than most is conscious of the challenge one of his biggest achievement on the issue wa adding “opportunity” a a criterion in existing dot grant a practice buttigieg said he will resume this is something that will get a project a closer look during the competitive phase buttigieg said if you have an extension of transit into a neighborhood that s not had it that s a key example but a more ambitious yardstick that foxx and others are setting for buttigieg the biden administration and the democratic congress involves creating program specifically for equity and not just relying on the existing system of transportation funding which ha been largely status quo for decade “that’s the harder edge case can you create a dedicated funding program to tackle this ” said foxx “it would be a bold statement for them to create a pot of money specifically to knit neighborhood that have been divided back together ” said beth osborne the director of transportation for america and a former obama dot official of course creating funding expressly for equity program would likely require an act of congress senate majority leader chuck schumer ha proposed a billion pilot program to help community pay for tearing down urban highway which the biden administration ha acknowledged were often built in a way that damaged black community transportation for america ha also proposed an aggressive program which would establish land trust to help boost community in those neighborhood but there is still plenty of work for the administration to do and the impact of having the white house lend it considerable heft and leadership behind an effort can t be understated the covid bill ha used a blueprint masterminded by biden’s team and it’s clear that the biden administration can have significant influence over legislation in the united democratic government the soft power of detail separate from congress dot ha internal authority that buttigieg could utilize if he want to walk the walk including but also beyond reviving foxx’s addition of equity criterion to funding program he also will be the chief driver of not only policy at dot but also in setting priority that result in often intangible but still important cultural shift an example of the behind the scene decision that could make an impact is what go in the manual on uniform traffic control device plus page of dry standard issued by the federal highway administration it s intended to standardize thing like road marking to create certainty for traveler no matter where they re driving and includes rule for everything from when traffic crossing should be put into place to how lane should be divided on road the subject the manual cover couldn t be more mundane but critic like osborne believe they are too vehicle centric prioritizing the efficiency of car passing through neighborhood and setting rule which limit for example when community can install crosswalk or light “a lot of time it’s in these default it’s in the nudge the standard ” buttigieg agreed “the mutcd is a good example technically it’s not a policy but it ha the force of law because of the way it harmonizes standard for what all the different department use it’s a good example of a place that we need to consider with an equity lens ” built out to a nationwide scale these are the kind of decision that can have the biggest impact on people s daily life and shape neighborhood to help improve access to school and job and many transportation expert argue that while the manual get formally updated occasionally it and other guidance document like it within dot are due for a major overhaul foxx called the lower profile nudge under dot’s control “soft power ” “that could extend to whether or not sound barrier are put up near a freeway it could involve whether air noise continues to roll over low income community it could be a lot of thing we tried to build the muscle of using both type of authority when they were available to u ” foxx said building back better during his tenure foxx focused on equity speaking about how highway built in charlotte cut off the house he grew up in “it’s not unprecedented for a secretary to talk about these problem ” osborne said “secretary foxx did a great job of eloquently explaining what this mean at a personal level ” but past administration have struggled to move beyond being vocal about the issue she said buttigieg agreed with that assessment “secretary foxx wa very outspoken and very intentional about confronting the history of basically racist construction and highway destroying neighborhood ” he said “i think now there’s a chance to bring more resource to bear in doing something about that ” foxx who now work at ride hailing giant lyft ha challenged the assertion that his greatest achievement were rhetorical he pointed to not only dot’s work under his leadership to include equity a a criterion in major grant but also building out transit infrastructure in city that needed it and tearing down highway elsewhere he also worked to redistribute flight noise so that it doesn t disproportionately hurt poor community “i think there’s a tendency to undervalue the contribution of african american who have served in these role while i’m still able to articulate what i know to be true i’m going to do that not only for myself but also for others ” foxx told politico he said when he wa in the role not many people were focused on transportation a a civil right issue adjusting for what kind of environment i wa in i think we did about a much a anyone could have ” he said but the environment ha changed in the last few year foxx said citing the conversation around racial injustice spurred in part by the death of george floyd breonna taylor and ahmaud arbery “i think there’s a readiness for this conversation that may not have been there year ago ” he said “i hope that some of the piece we put in place can be picked up and deepened and taken beyond where we were able to take them at the time i think there’s likely an appetite today for expanding authority and giving the department more muscle to do more thing ” buttigieg for his part say he’s also not just talking he said he’s still learning about the uneven damage that transportation policy ha done historically and ha been reading about robert moses the mid th century builder whose highway design frequently led to the decimation of black neighborhood and who intentionally built bridge too low for bus to pas through blocking poorer black and puerto rican new yorkers from accessing beach and other space “i think there s got to be a lot of listening ” he said “not because i m new to these issue but because we need to understand the full scope of how we got here and because everyone need to be at the table in dealing with the solution ”',\n",

business to get to in the rule wa reformed to lower the threshold from down to though it wa still rarely used the senate that biden grew up in — remember he wa when he wa elected — largely passed bill by a simple majority vote including controversial bill when the debate wa over even senator who opposed the underlying bill would vote yes on what’s known a “cloture ” which mean closure of the debate that began to change first with harry reid d nev a senate minority leader determined to fight president george w bush but went into overdrive under senate majority leader mitch mcconnell r ky mcconnell effectively raised the threshold any legislation needed to vote in order to undermine president barack obama for more on the history this deconstructed episode from last month ha you covered for somebody like biden that phenomenon — that legislation need vote to pas — is a relatively new innovation not the beating heart of the senate a some people claim and nobody know that better perhaps than biden himself he alluded to his old school cred in an interview with george stephanopolous published tuesday evening by abc “i don’t think that you have to eliminate the filibuster you have to do it what it used to be when i first got to the senate back in the old day ” biden said “you had to stand up and command the floor you had to keep talking ” “you’re for bringing back the talking filibuster ” stephanopulos asked “i am that’s what it wa supposed to be ” biden said “it’s getting to the point where you know democracy is having a hard time functioning ” notice that biden is using the credibility he owns a a senate traditionalist — he wa elected six year before i wa even born and i’m getting old — to make the case that reform is necessary to defend democracy and return the senate to the working condition it wa in when he got there it’s no secret that biden wa far from progressives’ first choice to win the democratic nomination but he may posse a unique ability to disarm centrist and conservative democrat who otherwise might oppose the same project or program if it wa proposed by sen bernie sander i vt elizabeth warren d mass or really anybody but biden sen ted cruz r texas recently criticized biden a “boring but radical ” while cruz is never serious about anything and biden is far from a radical there’s some truth even if cruz doesn’t recognize it behind that point a trillion stimulus just scan among the public a more “reasonable” when coming from biden than it would from a democrat whom republican could more easily paint a a radical a task that they managed to accomplish with obama even though he governed a a centrist there is a genuine only nixon could go to china element to biden’s gentle evisceration of the filibuster had sander or warren suggested change to the filibuster you can be sure that west virginia sen joe manchin the self styled exemplar of the moderate democratic centrist would be hearing none of it instead in his interview tuesday night biden wa merely following manchin who ha recently opened up to the idea of bringing back the “talking filibuster ” how biden can do it so what would these new filibuster rule look like nobody yet know but from conversation with senate source over the past few week month and year i can take a few stab first of all the vote threshold for cloture ha to go the current rule put the onus on the majority to marshal vote which no majority is likely to have for the foreseeable future if democrat do manage to reform the filibuster you have to assume this much they will not go through all that trouble simply to leave mcconnell with a veto over their agenda how they strip that veto remains to be seen but the new rule would shift the onus from the majority which today need to the minority which today barely ha to show up a manchin say you have to extract a cost for the minority to obstruct to make them actually be there on the floor “maybe it ha to be more painful maybe you have to make them stand there ” manchin told fox news earlier this month if democrat do manage to reform the filibuster they will not go through all that trouble simply to leave mcconnell with a veto over their agenda so if cloture can’t stay at how do you get it to a place where a majority can reasonably reach it one solution is to deploy the “present and voting” approach the possible rule go like this if three fifth of senator present and voting support cloture then cloture is invoked and the debate is over democrat who support the notion of for cloture could think of three fifth a a synonym that would mean that if all democratic senator showed up at a m to call the vote republican would need by my math senator ready to vote no they can do that sometimes but eventually democrat — or any future majority — would wear them down and find a moment where enough of them are literally sleeping that they can move it across the floor another approach could be to require vote to sustain a filibuster at any time under the current rule if a cloture vote get yes and zero no vote the no vote still win you could flip that to say that unless senator insist that the talking continue the debate is over and again if that vote is called at a m there may not be senator able to get there within the allotted time the present and voting standard ha a long senate tradition — longer in fact than the vote threshold in a the u s wa gripped with war fever a handful of anti war senator filibustered their way into senate adjournment blocking a vote on a declaration of war against germany a story recounted by longtime senate aide adam jentleson in his new book “kill switch the rise of the modern senate and the crippling of american democracy ” amid an uproar the senate implemented a cloture rule that allowed two third of those present and voting to bring debate to an end when the threshold wa moved down to three fifth in the present and voting standard wa replaced by an affirmative need to hit biden and manchin’s reform would return it to how it wa when biden entered the senate in a roundabout way manchin confessed to fox news that the current iteration of the vote threshold is on the chopping block “there’s different way to get to that vote and people have to make sure that they’re willing to show up — it would be great don’t you think if someone wa down there

the rest of the hemisphere will look like ” advertisement lópez obrador said earlier that he would use his meeting with biden to promote a plan similar to the “bracero” program of the s and s a kind of guest worker system that allowed million of mexican to enter the u s legally to work in agriculture mexican farmworkers provide the bulk of the labor force picking fruit and vegetable and harvesting other crop in california and elsewhere “we are going to deal with this issue you need mexican and central american worker ” lópez obrador said over the weekend “so let’s put order to the

no longer dealing with trump lópez obrador enjoyed a cordial relationship with the former president despite the border tension although trump often drove foreign policy with mexico via incendiary tweet that played to his nativist political base lópez obrador agreed to the restrictive u s immigration control primarily to avoid trump’s threatened tariff on mexican export it wa a surprising about face for lópez obrador a left wing populist who once likened trump to adolf hitler for his treatment of migrant although mexico paid nothing for trump’s partial border wall despite trump’s repeated claim that it would lópez obrador did send troop to his country’s southern border with guatemala to obstruct a wave of asylum seeker bound for the united state mexico held about people seeking u s asylum while they waited for date in immigration court a policy known a “remain in mexico ” biden suspended the policy on his first day in office and later announced that people could be released in

marathon engagement ” the official said enrique quinta a political analyst for the newspaper el financiero in mexico city using the acronym by which the mexican president is known said “the personal relationship that amlo had with trump will not exist the chemistry between an establishment politician like biden and a mexican president who considers himself disruptive doe not augur well ”

during the trump administration to remain in the u s permanently although not necessarily a citizen “we will explore lawful pathway for them to remain in the united state and to address the family need ” mayorkas told reporter at the white house “we are acting a restoratively a possible ” advertisement biden ha not rolled back trump’s march order that cited the public health crisis to expel anyone arriving at the u s border from mexico without giving them an opportunity to seek asylum a a result of that policy border authority have quickly expelled hundred of thousand of migrant
